== Version

Built On: {docdate} +
Version: 1.0.0

== Dependencies

Requires OpenCL version 1.2 or later.

This extension is written against the wording of the OpenCL 3.0
Specification.

== Overview

This extension extends the functionality provided by
*clCreateBuffer* and *clCreateImage* to allow the OpenCL
implementation to allocate memory on the device which
is also cached on the host CPU.

== New API Enums

Accepted value for the _flags_ parameter to *clCreateBuffer* and *clCreateImage*:

[source,c]
----
CL_MEM_USE_UNCACHED_CPU_MEMORY_IMG (1 << 26)
CL_MEM_USE_CACHED_CPU_MEMORY_IMG   (1 << 27)

| Memory Flags
| Description

| `CL_MEM_USE_UNCACHED_CPU_MEMORY_IMG`
| If this flag is specified it means that the application wants the OpenCL implementation to allocate memory on the device so that it is not cached when accessed on the host.

| `CL_MEM_USE_CACHED_CPU_MEMORY_IMG`
| If this flag is specified it means that the application wants the OpenCL implementation to allocate memory on the device so that it is cached when accessed on the host.

== Issues

. This extension may or may not improve performance; it depends on the
specific use-case. It is most likely to improve performance in cases
where the buffer or image is mapped using clEnqueueMapBuffer/Image
and some processing is then performed on the host-side. Whether the
allocation flag improves performance depends on whether the overhead
of cache flushes is greater than the performance gain from cached
memory accessing when doing the host-side processing. It's recommended
to apply the flag on case-by-case basis to see if it improves your
use-case.
