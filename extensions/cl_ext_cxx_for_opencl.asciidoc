== Notice

include::../copyrights.txt[]

== Version

Built On: {docdate} +
Version: 1.0.0

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the OpenCL Specification
Version 3.0.3.

This extension requires OpenCL 3.0 with OpenCL C 2.0 support or OpenCL 2.x and
`cl_khr_extended_versioning`.

== Overview

This extension adds support for building programs written using the C++ for
OpenCL kernel language documented in the *OpenCL-Docs* repository
(https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Docs)
with stable versions published in releases of the repository.

This extension also enables applications to query the version of the language
supported by the device compiler.

== New build option

This extension adds support for a new `CLC++` value to be passed to the
`-cl-std` build option accepted by *clBuildProgram* and *clCompileProgram*.

== New API Enums

Accepted value for the _param_name_ parameter to *clGetDeviceInfo*:

[source,c]
----
CL_DEVICE_CXX_FOR_OPENCL_NUMERIC_VERSION_EXT       0x4230
----

== Preprocessor Macros

This extension defines a new language, instead of extending an existing
language. As such, there will be no preprocessor `#define` matching the
extension name string. Instead, dedicated preprocessor macros conveying
language version information are available as described in the C++ for
OpenCL Programming Language Documentation, section 2.2.2.2 "Predefined
macros".


== Modifications to the OpenCL API Specification

(Modify Section 4.2, *Querying Devices*) ::

| Description

| `CL_DEVICE_CXX_FOR_OPENCL_NUMERIC_VERSION_EXT`
| `cl_version`
| Returns the version of the C++ for OpenCL language supported by the
  device compiler.

(Modify Section 5.8.1, *Creating Program Objects*) ::
+
--
Add the following text to the description for *clCreateProgramWithSource*:

The source code specified by _strings_ may also be a C++ for OpenCL program source
or header.
--

(Modify section to 5.8.6, *Compiler Options*) ::
+
--

(Add subsection, *C++ for OpenCL*) ::
+
--
Applications may pass `-cl-std=CLC\++` to *clCompileProgram* and *clBuildProgram*
for programs created using *clCreateProgramFromSource* to request the program
be built as C++ for OpenCL.
--

== Conformance tests

. Test that a program can successfully be compiled with `-cl-std=CLC++`.
. Test with a program compiled with `-cl-std=CLC++` that the value of the
  +__OPENCL_CPP_VERSION__+ macro agrees with the version returned by
  `CL_DEVICE_CXX_FOR_OPENCL_NUMERIC_VERSION_EXT`.

== Issues

None.
