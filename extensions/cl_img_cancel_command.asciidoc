== Version

Built On: {docdate} +
Version: 1.0.0

== Dependencies

Requires OpenCL version 3.0 or later.

This extension is written against the wording of the OpenCL 3.0 Specification.

== Overview

This extension adds the functionality to instruct the OpenCL implementation that an incomplete OpenCL command no longer needs to be executed.

== New API Functions

[source]
----
cl_int clCancelCommandsIMG(
    const cl_event *event_list,
    size_t num_events_in_list)
----

== New API Enums

[source,opencl]
----
CL_CANCELLED_IMG -1126

== Modifications to the OpenCL API Specification

(Add Section 5.16, *Cancelling Queued Commands*) ::
+

The function

[source]
----
cl_int clCancelCommandsIMG(
    size_t num_events_in_list,
    const cl_event *event_list);
----
is used to inform the OpenCL implementation that a list of commands that were previously enqueued are no longer required. +
Any commands belonging to events in the _event_list_ that are in the `CL_QUEUED` state will not be executed. These events will be set to the `CL_CANCELLED_IMG` state. +
Any commands belonging to events in the _event_list_ that are in the `CL_SUBMITTED` might not be executed. These events will be set to the `CL_CANCELLED_IMG` state. +
Any commands belonging to events in the _event_list_ that are in the `CL_RUNNING`, `CL_COMPLETE` or an error state will not be affected. +
Any other command in the `CL_QUEUED` state that has a `CL_CANCELLED_IMG` event in its event_wait_list will not be executed. The events belonging to these commands will also be set to the `CL_CANCELLED_IMG` state.

_event_list_ and _num_events_in_list_ specify events that belong to commands that no longer need to be executed.
If _event_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_list_ must be 0.
If _event_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by _event_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_list_ must be greater than 0.

*clCancelCommandsIMG* returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully, otherwise it returns one of the following errors:

* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if _event_list_ is `NULL` and _num_events_in_list_ is greater than 0.
* `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if _event_list_ is not `NULL` and _num_events_in_list_ is 0.
* `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the	OpenCL implementation on the device.
* `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
