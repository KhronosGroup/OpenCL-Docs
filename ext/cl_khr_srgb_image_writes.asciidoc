[[cl_khr_srgb_image_writes]]
== sRGB Image Writes

This section describes the *cl_khr_srgb_image_writes* extension.

This extension enables kernels to write to sRGB images using the *write_imagef* built-in function.
The sRGB image formats that may be written to will be returned by *clGetSupportedImageFormats*.

When the image is an sRGB image, the *write_imagef* built-in function will perform the linear to sRGB conversion.
Only the R, G, and B components are converted from linear to sRGB; the A component is written as-is.
