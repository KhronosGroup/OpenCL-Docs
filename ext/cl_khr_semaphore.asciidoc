[[cl_khr_semaphore]]
== Semaphores (Provisional)

OpenCL provides {cl_event_TYPE} as a primary mechanism of synchronization between host and device as well as across devices.
While events can be waited on or can be passed as dependencies across work-submissions, they suffer from following limitations:

* They are immutable.

* They are not reusable.

This extension introduces a new type of synchronization object to represent semaphores that can be reused, waited on, and signaled multiple times by OpenCL work-submissions.

In particular, this extension defines:

* A new type called {cl_semaphore_khr_TYPE} to represent the semaphore objects.

* A new type called {cl_semaphore_properties_khr_TYPE} to specify metadata associated with semaphores.

* Routines to create, retain, and release semaphores.

* Routines to wait on and signal semaphore objects.

* Routine to query the properties of semaphore objects.

=== Modifications to existing APIs added by this spec

Following new enums are added to the list of supported _param_names_ by {clGetPlatformInfo}:

.List of supported param_names by {clGetPlatformInfo}
[width="100%",cols="<33%,<17%,<50%",options="header"]
|====
| Platform Info | Return Type | Description
| {CL_PLATFORM_SEMAPHORE_TYPES_KHR}
  | {cl_semaphore_type_khr_TYPE}[]
      | Returns the list of the semaphore types supported all devices in _platform_.
|====

{clGetPlatformInfo} when called with _param_name_ {CL_PLATFORM_SEMAPHORE_TYPES_KHR} must return common list of semaphore types supported by all devices in the platform.

Following new enums are added to the list of supported _param_names_ by {clGetDeviceInfo}:

.List of supported param_names by {clGetDeviceInfo}
[width="100%",cols="<33%,<17%,<50%",options="header"]
|====
| Device Info | Return Type | Description
| {CL_DEVICE_SEMAPHORE_TYPES_KHR}
  | {cl_semaphore_type_khr_TYPE}[]
      | Returns the list of the semaphore types supported by _device_.
|====

{clGetDeviceInfo} when called with param_name {CL_DEVICE_SEMAPHORE_TYPES_KHR} must return a non-empty list of semaphore types for at least one of the devices in the platform.
The results of this query should meet minimum requirements for {cl_semaphore_type_khr_TYPE} as described by <<Description of new types added by this spec>>.

=== Description of new types added by this spec

Following new types are added:

* {cl_semaphore_type_khr_TYPE} to represent the different types of semaphores.
    ** It is mandatory to support {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY_KHR}.

* {cl_semaphore_properties_khr_TYPE} to represent properties associated with semaphores.
    ** {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_KHR} must be supported.

* {cl_semaphore_info_khr_TYPE} to represent queries to get additional information about semaphores.
    ** All enums described in New API Enums for {cl_semaphore_info_khr_TYPE} must be supported.

* {cl_semaphore_payload_khr_TYPE} to represent payload values of semaphores.

* {cl_semaphore_khr_TYPE} to represent semaphore objects.

Note that above types can be extended in future based on the need for additional types of semaphore and properties required by them.
The specifics of the same can be added as a newer version of this specification or by a separate specification that depends on this for basic semaphore support.

=== Description of new APIs added by this spec

The following new APIs are added as part of this spec. The details of each are described below:

==== Creating semaphores

A *semaphore object* may be created using the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCreateSemaphoreWithPropertiesKHR.txt[]

_context_ identifies a valid OpenCL context that the created {cl_semaphore_khr_TYPE} will belong to.

_sema_props_ specifies additional semaphore properties in the form list of <property_name, property_value> pairs terminated with 0.
{CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_KHR} must be part of the list of properties specified by _sema_props_.

Following new properties are added to the list of possible supported properties by {cl_semaphore_properties_khr_TYPE} that can be passed to {clCreateSemaphoreWithPropertiesKHR}:

.List of supported semaphore creation properties by {clCreateSemaphoreWithPropertiesKHR}
[width="100%",cols="<33%,<17%,<50%",options="header"]
|====
| Semaphore Property | Property Value | Description
| {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_KHR}
  | {cl_semaphore_type_khr_TYPE}
      | Specifies the type of semaphore to create. This property is always required.
| {CL_SEMAPHORE_DEVICE_HANDLE_LIST_KHR}
  | {cl_device_id_TYPE}[]
      | Specifies the list of OpenCL devices (terminated with {CL_SEMAPHORE_DEVICE_HANDLE_LIST_END_KHR}) to associate with the semaphore. Only a single device is permitted in the list.
|====

If {CL_SEMAPHORE_DEVICE_HANDLE_LIST_KHR} is not specified as part of _sema_props_, the semaphore object created by {clCreateSemaphoreWithPropertiesKHR} is by default accessible to all devices in the _context_.  For a multi-device context {CL_SEMAPHORE_DEVICE_HANDLE_LIST_KHR} must be specified in _sema_props_.

_errcode_ret_ returns an appropriate error code. If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

{clCreateSemaphoreWithPropertiesKHR} returns a valid semaphore object in an un-signaled state and and _errcode_ret_ is set to {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns a `NULL` value with one of the following error values returned in _errcode_ret_:

* {CL_INVALID_CONTEXT} if _context_ is not a valid context.
* {CL_INVALID_PROPERTY} if a property name in _sema_props_ is not a supported property name, if the value specified for a supported property name is not valid, or if the same property name is specified more than once. Additionally, if _context_ is a multiple device context and _sema_props_ does not specify {CL_SEMAPHORE_DEVICE_HANDLE_LIST_KHR}.
* {CL_INVALID_DEVICE} if {CL_SEMAPHORE_DEVICE_HANDLE_LIST_KHR} is specified as part of _sema_props_, but it does not identify exactly one valid device or if a device identified by {CL_SEMAPHORE_DEVICE_HANDLE_LIST_KHR} is not one of the devices within _context_.
* {CL_INVALID_VALUE}
** if _sema_props_ is `NULL`, or
** if _sema_props_ do not specify <property, value> pairs for minimum set of properties (i.e. {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_KHR}) required for successful creation of a {cl_semaphore_khr_TYPE}, or
* {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
* {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

==== Waiting on and signaling semaphores

To enqueue a command to wait on a set of semaphores, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR.txt[]

_command_queue_ specifies a valid command-queue.

_num_sema_objects_ specifies the number of semaphore objects to wait on.

_sema_objects_ points to the list of semaphore objects to wait on.
The length of the list must be at least _num_sema_objects_.

_sema_payload_list_ points to the list of values of type {cl_semaphore_payload_khr_TYPE} containing valid semaphore payload values to wait on.
This can be set to `NULL` or will be ignored when all semaphores in the list of _sema_objects_ are of type {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY_KHR}.

_num_events_in_wait_list_ specifies the number of events in _event_wait_list_.

_event_wait_list_ specifies list of events that need to complete before {clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} can be executed.
If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then {clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} does not wait on any event to complete.
If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be greater than 0.
The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as synchronization points.
The context associated with events in _event_wait_list_ and that associated with _command_queue_ must be the same.

_event_ returns an event object that identifies this particular command and can be used to query or queue a wait for this particular command to complete.
_event_ can be `NULL` in which case it will not be possible for the application to query the status of this command or queue a wait for this command to complete.

The semaphore wait command waits for a list of events to complete and a list of semaphore objects to become signaled.
The semaphore wait command returns an _event_ which can be waited on to ensure that all events in the _event_wait_list_ have completed and all semaphores in _sema_objects_ have been signaled.
{clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} will not return until the binary semaphores in _sema_objects_ are in a state that makes them safe to re-signal. If necessary, implementations may block in {clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} to ensure the correct state of semaphores when returning. There are no implications from this behavior for the state of _event_ or the events in _event_wait_list_ when {clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} returns. Waiting on the same binary semaphore twice without an interleaving signal may lead to undefined behavior.

{clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* {CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE}
** if _command_queue_ is not a valid command-queue, or
** if the device associated with _command_queue_ is not same as one of the devices specified by {CL_SEMAPHORE_DEVICE_HANDLE_LIST_KHR} at the time of creating one or more of _sema_objects_, or
** if one or more of _sema_objects_ belong to a context that does not contain a device associated with _command_queue_.
* {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _num_sema_objects_ is 0.
* {CL_INVALID_SEMAPHORE_KHR} if any of the semaphore objects specified by _sema_objects_ is not valid.
* {CL_INVALID_CONTEXT} if the context associated with _command_queue_ and any of the semaphore objects in _sema_objects_ are not the same or if the context associated with _command_queue_ and that associated with events in _event_wait_list_ are not the same.
* {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if any of the semaphore objects specified by _sema_objects_ requires a semaphore payload and _sema_payload_list_ is `NULL`.
* {CL_INVALID_EVENT_WAIT_LIST}
     ** if _event_wait_list_ is `NULL` and _num_events_in_wait_list_ is not 0, or
     ** if _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL` and _num_events_in_wait_list_ is 0, or
     ** if event objects in _event_wait_list_ are not valid events.
* {CL_EXEC_STATUS_ERROR_FOR_EVENTS_IN_WAIT_LIST} if the execution status of any of the events in _event_wait_list_ is a negative integer value.
* {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
* {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

To enqueue a command to signal a set of semaphores, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR.txt[]

_command_queue_ specifies a valid command-queue.

_num_sema_objects_ specifies the number of semaphore objects to signal.

_sema_objects_ points to the list of semaphore objects to signal.
The length of the list must be at least _num_sema_objects_.

_sema_payload_list_ points to the list of values of type {cl_semaphore_payload_khr_TYPE} containing semaphore payload values to signal.
This can be set to `NULL` or will be ignored when all semaphores in the list of _sema_objects_ are of type {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY_KHR}.

_num_events_in_wait_list_ specifies the number of events in event_wait_list.

_event_wait_list_ points to the list of events that need to complete before {clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} can be executed.
If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then {clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} does not wait on any event to complete.
If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by _event_wait_list_ must be valid and
_num_events_in_wait_list_ must be greater than 0.
The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as synchronization points.
The context associated with events in _event_wait_list_ and that associated with _command_queue_ must be the same.

_event_ returns an event object that identifies this particular command and can be used to query or queue a wait for this particular command to complete.
_event_ can be `NULL` in which case it will not be possible for the application to query the status of this command
or queue a wait for this command to complete.

The semaphore signal command waits for a list of events to complete and then signals a list of semaphore objects.
The semaphore signal command returns an _event_ which can be waited on to ensure that all events in the _event_wait_list_ have completed and all semaphores in _sema_objects_ have been signaled.
The successful completion of the event generated by {clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} called on one or more semaphore objects of type {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY_KHR} changes the state of the corresponding semaphore objects to signaled.  {clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} will not return until the binary semaphores in _sema_objects_ are in a state that makes them safe to wait on again.  If necessary, implementations may block in {clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} to ensure the correct state of semaphores when returning.  There are no implications from this behavior for the state of _event_ or the events in _event_wait_list_ when {clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} returns. Signaling the same binary semaphore twice without an interleaving wait may lead to undefined behavior.

{clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* {CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE}
** if _command_queue_ is not a valid command-queue, or
** if the device associated with _command_queue_ is not same as one of the devices specified by {CL_SEMAPHORE_DEVICE_HANDLE_LIST_KHR} at the time of creating one or more of _sema_objects_, or
** if one or more of _sema_objects_ belong to a context that does not contain a device associated with _command_queue_.
* {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _num_sema_objects_ is 0
* {CL_INVALID_SEMAPHORE_KHR} if any of the semaphore objects specified by _sema_objects_ is not valid.
* {CL_INVALID_CONTEXT} if the context associated with _command_queue_ and any of the semaphore objects in _sema_objects_ are not the same or if the context associated with _command_queue_ and that associated with events in _event_wait_list_ are not the same.
* {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if any of the semaphore objects specified by _sema_objects_ requires a semaphore payload and _sema_payload_list_ is `NULL`.
* {CL_INVALID_EVENT_WAIT_LIST}
    ** if _event_wait_list_ is `NULL` and _num_events_in_wait_list_ is not 0, or
    ** if _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL` and _num_events_in_wait_list_ is 0, or
    ** if event objects in _event_wait_list_ are not valid events.
* {CL_EXEC_STATUS_ERROR_FOR_EVENTS_IN_WAIT_LIST} if the execution status of any of the events in _event_wait_list_ is a negative integer value.
* {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
* {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

==== Semaphore Queries

To query information about a semaphore object, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clGetSemaphoreInfoKHR.txt[]

_sema_object_ specifies the semaphore object being queried.

_param_name_ is a constant that specifies the semaphore information to query, and must be one of the values shown in the <<cl_khr_semaphore_info-table,Semaphore Queries>> table.

_param_value_ is a pointer to memory where the result of the query is returned as described in the <<cl_khr_semaphore_info-table,Semaphore Queries>> table. If _param_value_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.

_param_value_size_ specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to _param_value_. This size must be greater than or equal to the size of the return type described in the <<cl_khr_semaphore_info-table,Semaphore Queries>> table.

_param_value_size_ret_ returns the actual size in bytes of data
being queried by _param_value_. If _param_value_size_ret_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.

[[cl_khr_semaphore_info-table]]
.List of supported param_names by {clGetSemaphoreInfoKHR}
[width="100%",cols="<33%,<17%,<50%",options="header"]
|====
| Semaphore Info | Return Type | Description
| {CL_SEMAPHORE_CONTEXT_KHR}
  | {cl_context_TYPE}
      | Returns the context specified when the semaphore is created.

| {CL_SEMAPHORE_REFERENCE_COUNT_KHR} footnote:[{fn-reference-count-usage}]
  | {cl_uint_TYPE}
      | Returns the semaphore reference count.

| {CL_SEMAPHORE_PROPERTIES_KHR}
  | {cl_semaphore_properties_khr_TYPE}[]
      | Return the properties argument specified in
        {clCreateSemaphoreWithPropertiesKHR}.

        The implementation must return the values specified in the properties
        argument in the same order and without including additional properties.

| {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_KHR}
  | {cl_semaphore_type_khr_TYPE}
      | Returns the semaphore type.

| {CL_SEMAPHORE_PAYLOAD_KHR}
  | {cl_semaphore_payload_khr_TYPE}
      | Returns the semaphore payload value. For semaphores of type
        {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY_KHR}, the payload value returned will be `0`
        if the semaphore is in an un-signaled state and `1` if it is in a
        signaled state.

| {CL_SEMAPHORE_DEVICE_HANDLE_LIST_KHR}
  | {cl_device_id_TYPE}[]
      | Returns the list of OpenCL devices the semaphore is associated with.
|====

{clGetSemaphoreInfoKHR} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the information is queried successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* {CL_INVALID_SEMAPHORE_KHR}
** if _sema_object_ is not a valid semaphore
* {CL_INVALID_VALUE}
** if _param_name_ is not one of the attribute defined in the <<cl_khr_semaphore_info-table,Semaphore Queries>> table or
** if _param_value_size_ is less than the size of Return Type of the corresponding _param_name_ attribute as defined in the <<cl_khr_semaphore_info-table,Semaphore Queries>> table.
* {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
* {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

==== Retaining and Releasing Semaphores

To release a semaphore object, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clReleaseSemaphoreKHR.txt[]

_sema_object_ specifies the semaphore object to be released.

The _sema_object_ reference count is decremented.

{clReleaseSemaphoreKHR} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* {CL_INVALID_SEMAPHORE_KHR} if _sema_object_ is not a valid semaphore object.
* {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
* {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

After the reference count becomes zero and commands queued for execution on a
command-queue(s) that use _sema_object_ have finished, the semaphore object is
deleted.
Using this function to release a reference that was not obtained by creating the
object via {clCreateSemaphoreWithPropertiesKHR} or by calling
{clRetainSemaphoreKHR} causes undefined behavior.

To retain a semaphore object, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clRetainSemaphoreKHR.txt[]

_sema_object_ specifies the semaphore object to be retained.

increments the reference count of _sema_object_.

{clRetainSemaphoreKHR} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

* {CL_INVALID_SEMAPHORE_KHR} if _sema_object_ is not a valid semaphore object.
* {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
* {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
