[[cl_khr_pci_bus_info]]
== PCI Bus Information Query

This extension adds a new query to obtain PCI bus information about an OpenCL
device.

Not all OpenCL devices have PCI bus information, either due to the device not
being connected to the system through a PCI interface or due to platform
specific restrictions and policies. Thus this extension is only expected to be
supported by OpenCL devices which can provide the information.

As a consequence, applications should always check for the presence of the
extension string for each individual OpenCL device for which they intend to
issue the new query for and should not have any assumptions about the
availability of the extension on any given platform.

=== General information

==== Version History

[cols="1,1,3",options="header",]
|====
| *Date*     | *Version* | *Description*
| 2021-04-19 | 1.0.0     | Initial version.
|====

==== Dependencies

This extension is written against the OpenCL API Specification Version V3.0.6.

This extension requires OpenCL 1.0.

=== New API Types

Structure returned by the device info query for `CL_DEVICE_PCI_BUS_INFO_KHR`:

[source,opencl]
----
typedef struct _cl_device_pci_bus_info_khr {
    cl_uint   pci_domain;
    cl_uint   pci_bus;
    cl_uint   pci_device;
    cl_uint   pci_function;
} cl_device_pci_bus_info_khr;
----

=== New API Enums

Accepted value for the _param_name_ parameter to *clGetDeviceInfo*:

[source,opencl]
----
#define CL_DEVICE_PCI_BUS_INFO_KHR  0x410F
----

=== Modifications to the OpenCL API Specification

==== Section 4.2 - Querying Devices:

Add to Table 5 - OpenCL Device Queries:

[caption="Table 5. "]
.OpenCL Device Queries
[width="100%",cols="<30%,<20%,<50%",options="header"]
|====
| *cl_device_info* | Return Type | Description
| `CL_DEVICE_PCI_BUS_INFO_KHR`
  | `cl_device_pci_bus_info_khr`
    | Returns PCI bus information for the device.

      The PCI bus information is returned as a single structure that includes
      the PCI bus domain, the PCI bus identifier, the PCI device identifier, and
      the PCI device function identifier.
