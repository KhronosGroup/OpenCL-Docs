[[cl_khr_subgroup_named_barrier]]
== Named Barriers for Subgroups

This section describes the *cl_khr_subgroup_named_barrier* extension.
This extension adds barrier operations that cover subsets of an OpenCL
work-group.
Only the OpenCL API changes are described in this section.
Please refer to the SPIR-V specification for information about using
subgroups named barriers in the SPIR-V intermediate representation, and to
the OpenCL {cpp} specification for descriptions of the subgroup named
barrier built-in functions in the OpenCL {cpp} kernel language.
