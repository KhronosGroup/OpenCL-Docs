[[cl_khr_3d_image_writes]]
== Writing to 3D Image Objects

This section describes the *cl_khr_3d_image_writes* extension.

This extension adds built-in functions that allow a kernel to write to 3D image objects in addition to 2D image objects.

This extension became a core feature in OpenCL 2.0.

The new built-in functions are described in the table below:

// Editors note: There are no access qualifiers on these built-in
// functions, because read-write images did not exist pre-OpenCL 2.0.

|*Function*
|*Description*

|void *write_imagef* ( +
image3d_t _image_, +
int4 _coord_, +
float4 _color_) +
{blank}
void *write_imagei* ( +
image3d_t _image_, +
int4 _coord_, +
int4 _color_) +
{blank}
void *write_imageui* ( +
image3d_t _image_, +
int4 _coord_, +
uint4 _color_)
|Write _color_ value to the location specified by coordinate (_x_, _y_, _z_) in the 3D image specified by _image_.
The appropriate data format conversion to the specified image format is done before writing the color value.
_coord.x_, _coord.y_, and _coord.z_ are considered to be unnormalized coordinates and must be in the range 0 ... image width - 1, 0 ... image height - 1, and 0 ... image depth - 1. +
{blank}
*write_imagef* can only be used with image objects created with _image_channel_data_type_ set to one of the pre-defined packed formats or set to {CL_SNORM_INT8}, {CL_UNORM_INT8}, {CL_SNORM_INT16}, {CL_UNORM_INT16}, {CL_HALF_FLOAT}, or {CL_FLOAT}.  Appropriate data format conversion will be done to convert the channel data from a floating-point value to the actual data format in which the channels are stored. +
{blank}
*write_imagei* can only be used with image objects created with _image_channel_data_type_ set to one of the following values: +
{CL_SIGNED_INT8}, +
{CL_SIGNED_INT16}, or +
{CL_SIGNED_INT32}. +
{blank}
*write_imageui* can only be used with image objects created with _image_channel_data_type_ set to one of the following values: +
{CL_UNSIGNED_INT8}, +
{CL_UNSIGNED_INT16}, or +
{CL_UNSIGNED_INT32}. +
{blank}
The behavior of *write_imagef*, *write_imagei*, and *write_imageui* for image objects created with _image_channel_data_type_ values not specified in the description above, or with (_x_, _y_, _z_) coordinate values that are not in the range (0 ... image width - 1, 0 ... image height - 1, 0 ... image depth - 1) respectively, is undefined.
