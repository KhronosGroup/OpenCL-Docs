[[cl_khr_gl_depth_images]]
== Sharing OpenGL and OpenGL ES Depth and Depth-Stencil Images

This section describes the *cl_khr_gl_depth_images* extension.
The *cl_khr_gl_depth_images* extends OpenCL / OpenGL sharing (the
cl_khr_gl_sharing_extension) defined in
<<cl_khr_gl_sharing__memobjs,Creating OpenCL Memory Objects from OpenGL
Objects>> to allow an OpenCL image to be created from an OpenGL depth or
depth-stencil texture.

=== Additions to Chapter 5 of the OpenCL 2.2 Specification

The *cl_khr_gl_depth_images* extension extends OpenCL / OpenGL sharing by
allowing an OpenCL depth image to be created from an OpenGL depth or
depth-stencil texture.
Depth images with an image channel order of CL_DEPTH_STENCIL can only be
created using the *clCreateFromGLTexture* API.

This extension adds the following new image format for depth-stencil images
to _table 5.6 and 5.7_ of the OpenCL 2.2 specification.

|====
| *Enum values that can be specified in channel_order*

| *CL_DEPTH_STENCIL*.
  This format can only be used if channel data type = CL_UNORM_INT24 or
  CL_FLOAT.

| *Image Channel Data Type*
| *Description*

| *CL_UNORM_INT24*
| Each channel component is a normalized unsigned 24-bit integer value

| *CL_FLOAT*
| Each channel component is a single precision floating-point value
|====

This extension adds the following new image format to the minimum list of
supported image formats described in _tables 5.8.a_ and _5.8.b_.

|====

For the image format given by channel order of CL_DEPTH_STENCIL and channel
data type of CL_UNORM_INT24, the depth is stored as an unsigned normalized
24-bit value.

For the image format given by channel order of CL DEPTH_STENCIL and channel
data type of CL_FLOAT, each pixel is two 32-bit values.
The depth is stored as a single precision floating-point value followed by
the stencil which is stored as a 8-bit integer value.

The stencil value cannot be read or written using the *read_imagef* and
*write_imagef* built-in functions in an OpenCL kernel.

Depth image objects with an image channel order equal to CL_DEPTH_STENCIL
cannot be used as arguments to clEnqueueReadImage, clEnqueueWriteImage,
clEnqueueCopyImage, clEnqueueCopyImageToBuffer, clEnqueueCopyBufferToImage,
clEnqueueMapImage and clEnqueueFillImage and will return a
CL_INVALID_OPERATION error.

[[cl_khr_gl_depth_images-additions-to-extension-specification]]
=== Additions to the OpenCL Extension Specification

The following new image formats are added to the table of
<<cl_khr_gl_sharing__memobjs-mapping-of-image-formats,OpenGL internal
formats and corresponding OpenCL internal formats>> in the OpenCL extension
specification.
If an OpenGL texture object with an internal format in this table is
successfully created by OpenGL, then there is guaranteed to be a mapping to
one of the corresponding OpenCL image format(s) in that table.
