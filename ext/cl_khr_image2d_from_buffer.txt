== Creating a 2D Image From A Buffer

This section describes the *cl_khr_image2d_from_buffer extensions. This extension allows a 2D image to be created from an existing OpenCL buffer memory object.

=== Additions to Chapter 4 of the OpenCL 1.2 Specification

The following table entry describes the additions to _table 4.3,_ which allows applications to query the configuration information using *clGetDeviceInfo* for an OpenCL device that supports creating a 2D image from a buffer.

[cols="2,1,2",options="header",]

|*cl_device_info*
|*Return Type*
|*Description*

|*CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_ +
PITCH_ALIGNMENT*
|cl_uint
|The row pitch alignment size in pixels for images created from a buffer.  The value returned must be a power of 2. +
{blank}
If the device does not support images, this value should be 0.

|*CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_ +
BASE_ADDRESS_ALIGNMENT*
|cl_uint
|This query should be used when an image is created from a buffer which was created using +CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR+. The value returned must be a power of 2. +
{blank}
This query specifies the minimum alignment in pixels of the _host_ptr_ specified to *clCreateBuffer*. +
{blank}
If the device does not support images, this value should be 0.

=== Additions to Chapter 5 of the OpenCL 1.2 Specification

Add to Section 5.3.1: Creating Image Objects:

A 2D image can be created from a buffer by specifying a buffer object in the +image_desc->buffer+ passed to *clCreateImage* for +image_desc->image_type+ equal to +CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE2D+. When the 2D image from buffer is created, the client must specify the width, height and image format (i.e. channel order and channel data type). If these are not specified, *clCreateImage* returns a NULL value with _errcode_ret_ set to +CL_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT_DESCRIPTOR+.  The pitch can be optionally specified. If the pitch is not specified, the pitch is computed as width * bytes per pixel based on the image format. 

The pitch specified (or computed if pitch specified is 0) must be a multiple of the maximum of the +CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_PITCH_ALIGNMENT+ value for all devices in the context associated with +image_desc->buffer+ that support images.  Otherwise, *clCreateImage* returns a NULL value with _errcode_ret_ set to +CL_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT_DESCRIPTOR+.

If +image_desc->buffer+ is created with +CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR+, the _host_ptr_ specified to clCreateBuffer must be aligned to the maximum of the +CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_BASE_ADDRESS_ALIGNMENT+ value for all devices in the context associated with image_desc->buffer that support images.  Otherwise, *clCreateImage* returns a NULL value with _errcode_ret_ set to +CL_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT_DESCRIPTOR+.

The minimum list of supported image formats described in _table 5.8_ of the OpenCL 1.2 specification must be supported for 2D images created from a buffer.

The OpenCL runtime APIs that operate on images (i.e. clEnqueueReadImage, clEnqueueWriteImage, clEnqueueFillImage, clEnqueueCopyImage, clEnqueueCopyImageToBuffer, clEnqueueCopyBufferToImage and clEnqueueMapImage) are supported for a 2D image created from a buffer.

When the contents of a buffer objects data store are modified, those changes are reflected in the contents of the 2D image object and vice-versa at corresponding synchronization points. The 
image_height * image_row_pitch specified in image_desc must be <= size of buffer object data 
store.

NOTE: Concurrent reading from, writing to and copying between both a buffer object and the 2D image object associated with the buffer object is undefined. Only reading from both a buffer object and 2D image object associated with the buffer object is defined. A 2D image or a 2D image created form a buffer use the same image type in OpenCL C i.e. image2d_t. The image built-ins functions described in _section 6.12.14.2_, _6.12.14.3_, _6.12.14.4_ and _6.12.14.5_ for image2d_t behave the same way for a 2D image and a 2D image from a buffer.
