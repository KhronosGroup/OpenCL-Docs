[[cl_khr_subgroup_rotate]]
== Subgroup Rotation

This extension adds support for a new subgroup data exchange operation that
makes it possible to rotate values through the work items in a subgroup.

=== New OpenCL C Functions

This extension adds the following built-in function:

[source,opencl_c]
----
gentype sub_group_rotate(gentype value, int delta)
gentype sub_group_clustered_rotate(gentype value, int delta, uint clustersize)
----

=== Modifications to the OpenCL C Specification

(Add a new section 6.15.x, *Subgroup Rotation*) ::
+
--

The following preprocessor definitions are added:

[source,opencl_c]
----
#define cl_khr_subgroup_rotate 1
----

The table below describes a specialized OpenCL C programming language built-in
function that allow work items in a subgroup to exchange data. This function
need not be encountered by all work items in a subgroup executing the kernel.
For the functions below, the generic type name `gentype` may be one of the
supported built-in scalar data types `char`, `uchar`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`,
`uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `float`, `double` (if double precision is supported),
or `half` (if half precision is supported).

|*Function*
|*Description*

|[source,opencl_c]
----
gentype sub_group_rotate(
    gentype value, int delta)
----
| Returns _value_ for the work item with subgroup local ID equal to the remainder
of the division of the sum of this work item's subgroup local ID and _delta_ by
the maximum subgroup size. +
The value of _delta_ is required to be dynamically-uniform for all work items in
the subgroup, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

The return value is undefined if the work item with subgroup local ID equal to the
calculated index is inactive.

|[source,opencl_c]
----
gentype sub_group_clustered_rotate(
    gentype value, int delta,
    uint clustersize)
----
| Returns _value_ for the work item with subgroup local ID equal to the sum of, the
remainder of the division of the sum of this work item's ID within the cluster and
_delta_ by _clustersize_, and the subgroup local ID of the first work-item of the
cluster to which the work-item executing the function belongs. +
The value of _delta_ is required to be dynamically-uniform for all work items in
the subgroup, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

_clustersize_ must be an integer constant expression and a power of two, smaller
than or equal to the maximum subgroup size, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

The return value is undefined if the work item with subgroup local ID equal to the
calculated index is inactive.

modifications described above apply.
