[[cl_khr_subgroup_rotate]]
== Sub-group Rotation

This extension adds support for a new sub-group data exchange operation that
makes it possible to rotate values through the work items in a sub-group.

=== New OpenCL C Functions

This extension adds the following built-in function:

[source,opencl_c]
----
gentype sub_group_rotate(gentype value, int delta)
gentype sub_group_clustered_rotate(gentype value, int delta, uint clustersize)
----

=== Modifications to the OpenCL C Specification

(Add a new section 6.15.x, *Sub-group Rotation*) ::
+
--

The following preprocessor definitions are added:

[source,opencl_c]
----
#define cl_khr_subgroup_rotate 1
----

The table below describes a specialized OpenCL C programming language built-in
function that allow work items in a sub-group to exchange data. This function
need not be encountered by all work items in a sub-group executing the kernel.
For the functions below, the generic type name `gentype` may be one of the
supported built-in scalar data types `char`, `uchar`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`,
`uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `float`, `double` (if double precision is supported),
or `half` (if half precision is supported).

|*Function*
|*Description*

|[source,opencl_c]
----
gentype sub_group_rotate(
    gentype value, int delta)
----
| Returns _value_ for the work item with sub-group local ID equal to the remainder
of the division of the sum of this work item's sub-group local ID and _delta_ by
the maximum sub-group size. +
The value of _delta_ is required to be dynamically-uniform for all work items in
the sub-group, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

The return value is undefined if the work item with sub-group local ID equal to the
calculated index is inactive.

|[source,opencl_c]
----
gentype sub_group_clustered_rotate(
    gentype value, int delta,
    uint clustersize)
----
| Returns _value_ for the work item with sub-group local ID equal to the sum of, the
remainder of the division of the sum of this work item's ID within the cluster and
_delta_ by _clustersize_, and the sub-group local ID of the first work-item of the
cluster to which the work-item executing the function belongs. +
The value of _delta_ is required to be dynamically-uniform for all work items in
the sub-group, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

_clustersize_ must be an integer constant expression and a power of two, smaller
than or equal to the maximum sub-group size, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

The return value is undefined if the work item with sub-group local ID equal to the
calculated index is inactive.

modifications described above apply.
