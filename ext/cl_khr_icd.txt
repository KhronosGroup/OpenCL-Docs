== OpenCL Installable Client Driver (ICD)

[[cl_khr_icd-overview]]
=== Overview

This section describes a platform extension which defines a simple mechanism through which the Khronos OpenCL installable client driver loader (ICD Loader) may expose multiple separate vendor installable client drivers (Vendor ICDs) for OpenCL. An application written against the ICD Loader will be able to access all cl_platform_ids exposed by all vendor implementations with the ICD Loader acting as a demultiplexor.

If this extension is supported by an implementation, the string *cl_khr_icd* will be present in the CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS string described in _table_ _4.1_.

[[cl_khr_icd-inferring-vendors-from-function-call-arguments]]
=== Inferring Vendors from Function Call Arguments

At every OpenCL function call, the ICD Loader infers the vendor ICD function to call from the arguments to the function. An object is said to be ICD compatible if it is of the following structure:

[source]
----
struct _cl_<object>
{
    struct _cl_icd_dispatch *dispatch;
    // ... remainder of internal data
};
----

<object> is one of platform_id, device_id, context, command_queue, mem, program, kernel, event, or sampler.

The structure +_cl_icd_dispatch+ is a function pointer dispatch table which is used to direct calls to a particular vendor implementation. All objects created from ICD compatible objects must be ICD compatible.

A link to source code which defines the entries in the function table structure +_cl_icd_dispatch+ is available in the Sample Code section of this document. The order of the functions in +_cl_icd_dispatch+ is determined by the ICD Loader's source. The ICD Loader's source's +_cl_icd_dispatch+ table is to be appended to only.

Functions which do not have an argument from which the vendor implementation may be inferred have been deprecated and may be ignored.

[[cl_khr_icd-icd-data]]
=== ICD Data

A Vendor ICD is defined by two pieces of data:

* The Vendor ICD library specifies a library which contains the OpenCL entry points for the vendor's OpenCL implementation. The vendor ICD's library file name should include the vendor name, or a vendor-specific implementation identifier. 
* The Vendor ICD extension suffix is a short string which specifies the default suffix for extensions implemented only by that vendor. The vendor suffix string is optional.

[[cl_khr_icd-icd-loader-vendor-enumeration-on-windows]]
=== ICD Loader Vendor Enumeration on Windows

To enumerate Vendor ICDs on Windows, the ICD Loader scans the values in the registry key +HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenCL\Vendors+. For each value in this key which has DWORD data set to 0, the ICD Loader opens the dynamic link library specified by the name of the value using LoadLibraryA.

For example, if the registry contains the following value

----
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenCL\Vendors]
"c:\\vendor a\\vndra_ocl.dll"=dword:00000000
----

then the ICD will open the library +"c:\vendor a\vndra_ocl.dll"+.

[[cl_khr_icd-icd-loader-vendor-enumeration-on-linux]]
=== ICD Loader Vendor Enumeration on Linux

To enumerate vendor ICDs on Linux, the ICD Loader scans the files in the path +/etc/OpenCL/vendors+. For each file in this path, the ICD Loader opens the file as a text file. The expected format for the file is a single line of text which specifies the Vendor ICD's library. The ICD Loader will attempt to open that file as a shared object using dlopen(). Note that the library specified may be an absolute path or just a file name.

For example, if the following file exists

----
/etc/OpenCL/vendors/VendorA.icd
----

and contains the text

----
libVendorAOpenCL.so
----

then the ICD Loader will load the library +"libVendorAOpenCL.so"+.

[[cl_khr_icd-icd-loader-vendor-enumeration-on-android]]
=== ICD Loader Vendor Enumeration on Android

To enumerate vendor ICDs on Android, the ICD Loader scans the files in the path +/system/vendor/Khronos/OpenCL/vendors+. For each file in this path, the ICD Loader opens the file as a text file. The expected format for the file is a single line of text which specifies the Vendor ICD's library. The ICD Loader will attempt to open that file as a shared object using dlopen(). Note that the library specified may be an absolute path or just a file name.

For example, if the following file exists

----
/system/vendor/Khronos/OpenCL/vendors/VendorA.icd
----

and contains the text

-----
libVendorAOpenCL.so
----

then the ICD Loader will load the library +"libVendorAOpenCL.so"+.

[[cl_khr_icd-adding-a-vendor-library]]
=== Adding a Vendor Library

Upon successfully loading a Vendor ICD's library, the ICD Loader queries the following functions from the library: *clIcdGetPlatformIDsKHR*, *clGetPlatformInfo*, and *clGetExtensionFunctionAddress* (note: *clGetExtensionFunctionAddress* has been deprecated, but is still required for the ICD loader). If any of these functions are not present then the ICD Loader will close and ignore the library.

Next the ICD Loader queries available ICD-enabled platforms in the library using *clIcdGetPlatformIDsKHR*. For each of these platforms, the ICD Loader queries the platform's extension string to verify that *cl_khr_icd* is supported, then queries the platform's Vendor ICD extension suffix using *clGetPlatformInfo* with the value CL_PLATFORM_ICD_SUFFIX_KHR.

If any of these steps fail, the ICD Loader will ignore the Vendor ICD and continue on to the next.

[[cl_khr_icd-additions-to-chapter-4]]
=== Additions to Chapter 4 of the OpenCL 2.2 Specification

In section 4.1, replace the description of the return values of clGetPlatformIDs with:

"clGetPlatformIDs returns CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed successfully and there are a non zero number of platforms available. It returns CL_PLATFORM_NOT_FOUND_KHR if zero platforms are available. It returns CL_INVALID_VALUE if <num_entries> is equal to zero and <platforms> is not NULL or if both <num_platforms> and <platforms> are NULL."

In _section 4.1_, add the following after the description of *clGetPlatformIDs*:

"The list of platforms accessible through the Khronos ICD Loader can be obtained using the following function:

indexterm:[clIcdGetPlatformIDsKHR]
[source]
----
cl_int clIcdGetPlatformIDsKHR(cl_uint num_entries,
                              cl_platform_id *platforms,
                              cl_uint *num_platforms);
----

_num_entries_ is the number of cl_platform_id entries that can be added to _platforms_. If _platforms_ is not NULL, then _num_entries_ must be greater than zero.

_platforms_ returns a list of OpenCL platforms available for access through the Khronos ICD Loader. The cl_platform_id values returned in _platforms_ are ICD compatible and can be used to identify a specific OpenCL platform. If the _platforms_ argument is NULL, then this argument is ignored. The number of OpenCL platforms returned is the minimum of the value specified by _num_entries_ or the number of OpenCL platforms available.

_num_platforms_ returns the number of OpenCL platforms available. If _num_platforms_ is NULL, then this argument is ignored.

*clIcdGetPlatformIDsKHR* returns CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed successfully and there are a non zero number of platforms available. It returns CL_PLATFORM_NOT_FOUND_KHR if zero platforms are available. It returns CL_INVALID_VALUE if _num_entries_ is equal to zero and _platforms_ is not NULL or if both _num_platforms_ and _platforms_ are NULL."

Add the following to _table 4.1_:

[cols="2,1,2",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|*cl_platform_info enum*
|*Return Type*
|*Description*

|*CL_PLATFORM_ICD_SUFFIX_KHR*
|char[]
|The function name suffix used to identify extension functions to be directed to this platform by the ICD Loader.

=== Source Code

The official source for the ICD loader is available at the Khronos website. The complete +_cl_icd_dispatch+ structure is defined in the header *icd_dispatch.h*, which is available as a part of the source code.

[[cl_khr_icd-issues]]
=== Issues

. Some OpenCL functions do not take an object argument from which their vendor library may be identified (e.g, clUnloadCompiler), how will they be handled?
+
--
RESOLVED: Such functions will be a noop for all calls through the ICD.
--

. How are OpenCL extension to be handled?
+
--
RESOLVED: OpenCL extension functions may be added to the ICD as soon as they are implemented by any vendor. The suffix mechanism provides access for vendor extensions which are not yet added to the ICD.
--

. How will the ICD handle a NULL cl_platform_id?
+
--
RESOLVED: The ICD will by default choose the first enumerated platform as the NULL platform. The user can override this default by setting an environment variable OPENCL_ICD_DEFAULT_PLATFORM to the desired platform
index. The API calls that deal with platforms will return CL_INVALID_PLATFORM if the index is not between zero and (number of platforms - 1), both inclusive.
--

. There exists no mechanism to unload the ICD, should there be one?
+
--
RESOLVED: As there is no standard mechanism for unloading a vendor implementation, do not add one for the ICD.
--

. How will the ICD loader handle NULL objects passed to the OpenCL functions?
+
--
RESOLVED: The ICD loader will check for NULL objects passed to the OpenCL functions without trying to dereference the NULL objects for obtaining the ICD dispatch table. On detecting a NULL object it will return one of the CL_INVALID_* error values corresponding to the object in question.
