[[cl_khr_byte_addressable_store]]
== Byte Addressable Stores

This section describes the *cl_khr_byte_addressable_store* extension.
This extension relaxes restrictions on pointers to `char`, `uchar`, `char2`, `uchar2`, `short`, `ushort` and `half` that were present in _Section 6.8m: Restrictions_ of the OpenCL 1.0 specification.
With this extension, applications are able to read from and write to pointers to these types.

This extension became a core feature in OpenCL 1.1.
