== Intermediate Language Programs

This extension adds the ability to create programs with intermediate language (IL),
usually SPIR-V.  Further information about the format and contents of SPIR-V may be
found in the SPIR-V Specification.  Information about how SPIR-V modules behave in
the OpenCL environment may be found in the OpenCL SPIR-V Environment Specification.

The name of this extension is *cl_khr_il_program*.
