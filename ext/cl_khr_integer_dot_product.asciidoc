| cl_device_info
| Return Type
| Description

| {CL_DEVICE_INTEGER_DOT_PRODUCT_CAPABILITIES_KHR}
| {cl_device_integer_dot_product_capabilities_khr_type}
| Returns the integer dot product capabilities supported by the device. +
 +
{CL_DEVICE_INTEGER_DOT_PRODUCT_INPUT_4x8BIT_PACKED_KHR} is always set
  indicating that all implementations that support `cl_khr_integer_dot_product`
  must support dot product built-in functions and, when SPIR-V is supported,
  SPIR-V instructions that take four-component vectors of 8-bit integers packed
  into 32-bit integers as input. +
{CL_DEVICE_INTEGER_DOT_PRODUCT_INPUT_4x8BIT_KHR} is set when dot product
  built-in functions and, when SPIR-V is supported, SPIR-V instructions that
  take four-component of 8-bit elements as input are supported. +
  NOTE: {CL_DEVICE_INTEGER_DOT_PRODUCT_INPUT_4x8BIT_KHR} must be set in version
  2.x of the extension.


| {CL_DEVICE_INTEGER_DOT_PRODUCT_ACCELERATION_PROPERTIES_8BIT_KHR}
| {cl_device_integer_dot_product_acceleration_properties_khr_TYPE}
| Returns a structure describing the exact 8-bit dot product combinations
  that are <<integer-dot-product-acceleration-properties,accelerated>> on the device. +
  Each member is {CL_TRUE} if the combination it corresponds to is accelerated,
  {CL_FALSE} otherwise. +
  NOTE: {CL_DEVICE_INTEGER_DOT_PRODUCT_ACCELERATION_PROPERTIES_8BIT_KHR} is missing
  before version 2.0 of the extension.

| {CL_DEVICE_INTEGER_DOT_PRODUCT_ACCELERATION_PROPERTIES_4x8BIT_PACKED_KHR}
| {cl_device_integer_dot_product_acceleration_properties_khr_TYPE}
| Returns a structure describing the exact 4x8-bit packed dot product combinations
  that are <<integer-dot-product-acceleration-properties,accelerated>> on the device. +
  Each member is {CL_TRUE} if the combination it corresponds to is accelerated,
  {CL_FALSE} otherwise. +
  NOTE: {CL_DEVICE_INTEGER_DOT_PRODUCT_ACCELERATION_PROPERTIES_4x8BIT_PACKED_KHR} is missing
  before version 2.0 of the extension.

[[integer-dot-product-acceleration-properties]]
The {cl_device_integer_dot_product_acceleration_properties_khr_TYPE} structure
describes the exact dot product operations that are accelerated on the device:

include::{generated}/api/structs/cl_device_integer_dot_product_acceleration_properties_khr.txt[]

 * _signed_accelerated_ is {CL_TRUE} when signed dot product operations are
   accelerated, {CL_FALSE} otherwise.
 * _unsigned_accelerated_ is {CL_TRUE} when unsigned dot product operations
   are accelerated, {CL_FALSE} otherwise.
 * _mixed_signedness_accelerated_ is {CL_TRUE} when mixed signedness dot
   product operations are accelerated, {CL_FALSE} otherwise.
 * _accumulating_saturating_signed_accelerated_ is {CL_TRUE} when accumulating
   saturating signed dot product operations are accelerated, {CL_FALSE}
   otherwise.
 * _accumulating_saturating_unsigned_accelerated_ is {CL_TRUE} when accumulating
   saturating unsigned dot product operations are accelerated, {CL_FALSE}
   otherwise.
 * _accumulating_saturating_mixed_signedness_accelerated_ is {CL_TRUE} when
   accumulating saturating mixed signedness dot product operations are
   accelerated, {CL_FALSE} otherwise.

A dot product operation is deemed accelerated if its implementation provides
a performance advantage over application-provided code composed from elementary
instructions and/or other dot product instructions, either because the
implementation uses optimized machine code sequences whose generation from
application-provided code cannot be guaranteed or because it uses hardware
features that cannot otherwise be targeted from application-provided code.

The following built-in functions and preprocessor definitions are added:

* `dot` returns the dot product of the two input vectors `a` and `b`. The
components of `a` and `b` are sign- or zero-extended to the width of the
destination type and the vectors with extended components are multiplied
component-wise. All the components of the resulting vectors are added
together to form the final result.

* `dot_acc_sat` returns the saturating addition of the dot product of the two
input vectors `a` and `b` and the accumulator `acc`:

----
product = dot(a,b);
result = add_sat(product, acc);
----

* `dot_*_4x8packed_XY_R` returns the dot product of the two vectors packed
into `a` and `b` (lowest component in least significant byte). The components
are unpacked, sign- or zero-extended to the width of the destination type before
the multiplications and additions. `X` represents the signedness of the components
of `a`, `Y` that of the components of `b`. `R` is the return type.

modifications described above apply.
