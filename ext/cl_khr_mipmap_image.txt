[[cl_khr_mipmap_image]]
== Mipmaps

This section describes OpenCL support for mipmaps.

There are two optional mipmap extensions.  The *cl_khr_mipmap_image* extension adds the ability to create a mip-mapped image, enqueue commands to read/write/copy/map/unmap a region of a mipmapped image, and built-in functions that can be used to read a mip-mapped image in an OpenCL C program. The *cl_khr_mipmap_image_writes* extension adds built-in functions that can be used to write a mip-mapped image in an OpenCL C program. If the *cl_khr_mipmap_image_writes* extension is supported by the OpenCL device, the *cl_khr_mipmap_image* extension must also be supported.

=== Additions to Chapter 5 of the OpenCL 2.2 Specification

[[cl_khr_mipmap_image-additions-to-section-5.3]]
==== Additions to section 5.3 – Image Objects

A mip-mapped 1D image, 1D image array, 2D image, 2D image array or 3D image is created by specifying _num_mip_levels_ to be a value greater than one in the _cl_image_desc_ passed to *clCreateImage*. The dimensions of a mip-mapped image can be a power of two or a non-power of two. Each successively smaller mipmap level is half the size of the previous level. If this half value is a fractional value, it is rounded down to the nearest integer.

*Restrictions*

The following restrictions apply when mip-mapped images are created with *clCreateImage*:

* CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR or CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR cannot be specified if a mip-mapped image is created.
* The _host_ptr_ argument to *clCreateImage* must be a NULL value.
* Mip-mapped images cannot be created for CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE1D_BUFFER images, depth images or multi-sampled (i.e. msaa) images.

Calls to *clEnqueueReadImage*, *clEnqueueWriteImage* and *clEnqueueMapImage* can be used to read from or write to a specific mip-level of a mip-mapped image. If image argument is a 1D image, _origin_[1] specifies the mip-level to use. If image argument is a 1D image array, _origin_[2] specifies the mip-level to use. If image argument is a 2D image, _origin_[2] specifies the mip-level to use. If image argument is a 2D image array or a 3D image, _origin_[3] specifies the mip-level to use.

Calls to *clEnqueueCopyImage*, *clEnqueueCopyImageToBuffer* and *clEnqueueCopyBufferToImage* can also be used to copy from and to a specific mip-level of a mip-mapped image. If _src_image_ argument is a 1D image, _src_origin_[1] specifies the mip-level to use. If _src_image_ argument is a 1D image array, _src_origin_[2] specifies the mip-level to use. If _src_image_ argument is a 2D image, _src_origin_[2] specifies the mip-level to use. If _src_image_ argument is a 2D image array or a 3D image, _src_origin_[3] specifies the mip-level to use. If _dst_image_ argument is a 1D image, _dst_origin_[1] specifies the mip-level to use. If _dst_image_ argument is a 1D image array, _dst_origin_[2] specifies the mip-level to use. If _dst_image_ argument is a 2D image, _dst_origin_[2] specifies the mip-level to use. If _dst_image_ argument is a 2D image array or a 3D image, _dst_origin_[3] specifies the mip-level to use.

If the mip level specified is not a valid value, these functions return the error CL_INVALID_MIP_LEVEL.

Calls to clEnqueueFillImage can be used to write to a specific mip-level of a mip-mapped image. If image argument is a 1D image, origin[1] specifies the mip-level to use. If image argument is a 1D image array, origin[2] specifies the mip-level to use. If image argument is a 2D image, origin[2] specifies the mip-level to use. If image argument is a 2D image array or a 3D image, origin[3] specifies the mip-level to use.

[[cl_khr_mipmap_image-additions-to-section-5.7]]
==== Additions to section 5.7 – Sampler Objects

Add the following sampler properties _to table 5.14_ that can be specified when a sampler object is created using *clCreateSamplerWithProperties*.

[cols="3,1,2",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|*cl_sampler_properties enum*
|*Property Value*
|*Default Value*

|*CL_SAMPLER_MIP_FILTER_MODE_KHR*
|cl_filter_mode
|CL_FILTER_NEAREST_KHR

|*CL_SAMPLER_LOD_MIN_KHR*
|cl_float
|0.0f

|*CL_SAMPLER_LOD_MAX_KHR*
|cl_float
|MAXFLOAT

|=======================================================================

NOTE: The sampler properties CL_SAMPLER_MIP_FILTER_MODE_KHR, CL_SAMPLER_LOD_MIN_KHR and CL_SAMPLER_LOD_MAX_KHR cannot be specified with any samplers initialized in the OpenCL program source. Only the default values for these properties will be used. To create a sampler with specific values for these properties, a sampler object must be created with *clCreateSamplerWithProperties* and passed as an argument to a kernel.

[[cl_khr_mipmap_image-additions-to-creating-opencl-memory-objects-from-opengl-objects]]
=== Additions to <<cl_khr_gl_sharing__memobjs,Creating OpenCL Memory Objects from OpenGL Objects>>

If both the *+cl_khr_mipmap_image+* and *+cl_khr_gl_sharing+* extensions are supported by the OpenCL device, the *+cl_khr_gl_sharing+* extension may also be used to create a mipmapped OpenCL image from a mipmapped OpenGL texture.

To create a mipmapped OpenCL image from a mipmapped OpenGL texture, pass a negative value as the _miplevel_ argument to *clCreateFromGLTexture*. If _miplevel_ is a negative value then an OpenCL mipmapped image object is created from a mipmapped OpenGL texture object, instead of an OpenCL image object for a specific miplevel of the OpenGL texture.

NOTE: For a detailed description of how the level of detail is computed, please refer to _section 3.9.7_ of the OpenGL 3.0 specification.
