[[cl_khr_int32_atomics]]
== 32-bit Atomics

This section describes the extensions *cl_khr_global_int32_base_atomics*, *cl_khr_global_int32_extended_atomics*, *cl_khr_local_int32_base_atomics*, and *cl_khr_local_int32_extended_atomics*.
These extensions allow atomic operations to be performed on 32-bit signed and unsigned integers in global and local memory.

These extensions became core features in OpenCL 1.1, except the built-in atomic function names are changed to use the **atomic_** prefix instead of **atom_** and the volatile qualifier was added to the pointer parameter _p_.
