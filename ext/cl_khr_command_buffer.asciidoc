=== Overview

Command-buffers enable a reduction in overhead when enqueuing the same
workload multiple times. By separating the command-queue setup from dispatch,
the ability to replay a set of previously created commands is introduced.

Device-side _cl_sync_point_khr_ synchronization-points can be used within
command-buffers to define command dependencies. This allows the commands of a
command-buffer to execute out-of-order on a single <<compatible, compatible>>
command-queue. The command-buffer itself has no inherent in-order/out-of-order
property, this ordering is inferred from the command-queue used on command
recording. Out-of-order enqueues without event dependencies of both regular
commands, such as {clEnqueueFillBuffer}, and command-buffers are allowed to
execute concurrently, and it is up to the user to express any dependencies using
events.

The command-queues a command-buffer will be executed on can be set on replay via
parameters to {clEnqueueCommandBufferKHR}, provided they are
<<compatible, compatible>> with the command-queues used on command-buffer
recording.

==== Background

On embedded devices where building a command stream accounts for a significant
expenditure of resources and where workloads are often required to be pipelined,
a solution that minimizes driver overhead can significantly improve the
utilization of accelerators by removing a bottleneck in repeated command stream
generation.

An additional motivator is lowering task execution latency, as devices can be
kept occupied with work by repeated submissions, without having to wait on
the host to construct commands again for a similar workload.

==== Rationale

The command-buffer abstraction over the generation of command streams is a
proven approach which facilitates a significant reduction in driver overhead in
existing real-world applications with repetitive pipelined workloads which are
built on top of Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal.

A primary goal is for a command-buffer to avoid any interaction with
application code after being enqueued until all recorded commands have
completed. As such, any command which maps or migrates memory objects; reads
or writes memory objects; or enqueues a native kernel, is not available for
command-buffer recording. Finally commands recorded into a command buffer do
not wait for or return event objects, these are instead replaced with
device-side synchronization-point identifiers which enable out-of-order
execution when enqueued on <<compatible, compatible>> command-queues.

Adding new entry-points for individual commands, rather than recording existing
command-queue APIs with begin/end markers was a design decision made for the
following reasons:

* Individually specified entry points makes it clearer to the user what's
  supported, as opposed to adding a large number of error conditions
  throughout the specification with all the restrictions.

* Prevents code forking in existing entry points for the implementer, as
  otherwise separate paths in each entry point need to be maintained for both
  the recording and normal cases.

* Allows the definition of a new device-side synchronization primitive rather
  than overloading {cl_event_TYPE}. As use of {cl_event_TYPE} in individual commands
  allows host interaction from callback and user-events, as well as introducing
  complexities when a command-buffer is enqueued multiple times regarding
  profiling and execution status.

* New entry points facilitate returning handles to individual commands, allowing
  those commands to be modified between enqueues of the command buffer. Not all
  command handles are used in this extension, but providing them facilitates
  other extensions layered on top to take advantage of them to provide additional
  mutable functionality.

==== Simultaneous Use

The optional simultaneous use capability was added to the extension so that
vendors can support pipelined workflows, where command-buffers are repeatedly
enqueued without blocking in user code. However, simultaneous use may result in
command-buffers being more expensive to enqueue than in a sequential model, so
the capability is optional to enable optimizations on command-buffer recording.

=== Interactions with Other Extensions

The introduction of the command-buffer abstraction enables functionality
beyond what the `cl_khr_command_buffer` extension currently provides, i.e.
the recording of immutable commands to a single queue which can then be
executed without commands synchronizing outside the command-buffer. It is
intended that extra functionality expanding on this will be provided as layered
extensions on top of `cl_khr_command_buffer`.

Having `cl_khr_command_buffer` as a minimal base specification means that the
API defines mechanisms for functionality that is not enabled by this extension,
these are described in the following sub-sections. `cl_khr_command_buffer` will
retain its provisional extension status until other layered extensions are
released, as these may reveal modifications needed to the base specification to
support their intended use cases.

==== ND-range Kernel Command Properties

The {clCommandNDRangeKernelKHR} entry-point defines a `properties` parameter of
new type {cl_ndrange_kernel_command_properties_khr_TYPE}. No properties are defined
in `cl_khr_command_buffer`, but the parameter is intended to enable future
functionality that would change the characteristics of the kernel command.

==== Command Handles

All command recording entry-points define a {cl_mutable_command_khr_TYPE} output
parameter which provides a handle to the specific command being recorded. Use of
these output handles is not enabled by the `cl_khr_command_buffer` extension,
but the handles will allow individual commands in a command-buffer to be
referenced by the user. In particular, the capability for an application to use
these handles to modify commands between enqueues of a command-buffer is
envisaged.

==== List of Queues

Only a single command-queue can be associated with a command-buffer in the
`cl_khr_command_buffer` extension, but the API is designed with the intention
that a future extension will allow commands to be recorded across multiple
queues in the same command-buffer, providing replay of heterogeneous task
graphs.

Using multiple queue functionality will result in an error without any layered
extensions to relax usage of the following API features:

* When a command-buffer is created the API enables passing a list of queues
  that the command-buffer will record commands to. Only a single queue is
  permitted in `cl_khr_command_buffer`.

* Individual command recording entry-points define a {cl_command_queue_TYPE}
  parameter for which of the queues set on command-buffer creation that command
  should be record to. This must be passed as NULL in `cl_khr_command_buffer`.

* {clEnqueueCommandBufferKHR} takes a list of queues for command-buffer execution,
  correspond to those set on creation. Only a single queue is permitted in
  `cl_khr_command_buffer`.

|====

[[command-buffers]]
=== Add new section "Section 5.X - Command Buffers" to OpenCL API Specification

A _command-buffer_ object represents a series of operations to be enqueued
on one or more command-queues without any application code interaction.
Grouping the operations together allows efficient enqueuing of repetitive
operations, as well as enabling driver optimizations.

Command-buffers are _sequential use_ by default, but may also be set to
_simultaneous use_ on creation if the device optionally supports this
capability. A sequential use command-buffer must have a <<pending_count,
Pending Count>> of 0 or 1. The simultaneous use capability removes this
restriction and allows command-buffers to have a <<pending_count, Pending
Count>> greater than 1.

[[compatible]]
Command-buffers are created using an ordered list of command-queues that
commands are recorded to and execute on by default. These command-queues can be
replaced on command-buffer enqueue with different command-queues, provided for
each element in the replacement list the substitute command-queue is compatible
with the command-queue used on command-buffer creation. Where a _compatible_
command-queue is defined as a command-queue with identical properties targeting
the same device and in the same OpenCL context.

While constructing a command-buffer it is valid for the user to interleave calls
to the same queue which create commands, such as {clCommandNDRangeKernelKHR}, with
queue submission calls, such as {clEnqueueNDRangeKernel} or
{clEnqueueCommandBufferKHR}. That is, there is no effect on queue state from
recording commands. The purpose of the queue parameter is to define the device
and properties of the command, which are constant queries on the queue object.

A command-buffer object should increment the reference count of attached OpenCL
objects such as queues, buffers, images, and kernels referenced in commands
recorded to the command-buffer. This enables correct behavior of the
command-buffer when its attached objects have been released. On destruction of
the command-buffer it should decrement these reference counts, allowing the
attached objects to be freed if appropriate.

[[command-buffer-kernel-argument-ref-counting]]
[NOTE]
====
A command-buffer object does not update the reference count of objects set as
arguments on kernels recorded into the command-buffer. This is consistent with
the reference counting behavior of {clSetKernelArg}.

Applications should ensure that objects passed as arguments to kernels recorded
to a command-buffer are not deleted until the command-buffer has been released.
Undefined behavior may result from the failure to follow this usage requirement
for all the command-buffers an object is used as a kernel argument in.

If using layered extension `cl_khr_command_buffer_mutable_dispatch`,
<<mutable-dispatch-kernel-argument-safe-usage,
see related note on safe usage>>.
====

==== Add new section "Section 5.X.1 - Command Buffer Lifecycle"

A command-buffer is always in one of the following states:

[[recording]]
Recording:: Initial state of a command-buffer on creation, where commands can be
recorded to the command-buffer.

[[executable]]
Executable:: State after command recording has finished with
{clFinalizeCommandBufferKHR} and the command-buffer may be enqueued.

[[pending]]
Pending:: Once a command-buffer has been enqueued to a command-queue it enters
the Pending state until completion, at which point it moves back to the
<<executable, Executable>> state.

[[pending_count]]
The Pending Count is the number of copies of the command
buffer in the <<pending, Pending>> state. By default a command-buffer's Pending
Count must be 0 or 1. If the command-buffer was created with
{CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_KHR} then the command-buffer may have a
Pending Count greater than 1.

==== Add new section "Section 5.X.2 - Creating Command Buffer Objects"

The function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCreateCommandBufferKHR.txt[]

Is used to create a command-buffer that can record commands to the specified
queues.

[NOTE]
====
Upon creation the command-buffer is defined as being in the
<<recording, Recording>> state, in order for the command-buffer to be enqueued
it must first be finalized using {clFinalizeCommandBufferKHR} after which no
further commands can be recorded. A command-buffer is submitted for execution
on command-queues with a call to {clEnqueueCommandBufferKHR}.
====

_num_queues_ The number of command-queues listed in _queues_. This extension
only supports a single command-queue, so this **must** be one.

_queues_  Is a pointer to a command-queue that the command-buffer commands will
be recorded to. _queues_ must be a non-`NULL` value.

_properties_  Specifies a list of properties for the command-buffer and their
corresponding values. Each property name is immediately followed by the
corresponding desired value. The list is terminated with 0.
The list of supported properties is described in the table below. If a
supported property and its value is not specified in properties, its
default value will be used. _properties_ can be `NULL` in which case the
default values for supported command-buffer properties will be used.

|====
| *Recording Properties*
| *Property Value*
| *Description*

| {CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_FLAGS_KHR}
| {cl_command_buffer_flags_khr_TYPE}
| This is a bitfield and can be set to a combination of the following values:

  {CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_KHR} - Allow multiple instances of the
  command-buffer to be submitted to the device for execution. If set, devices
  must support {CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_CAPABILITY_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_KHR}.

  The default value of this property is `0`.
|====

_errcode_ret_ Returns an appropriate error code. If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no
error code is returned.

{clCreateCommandBufferKHR} returns a valid non-zero command-buffer and
_errcode_ret_ is set to {CL_SUCCESS} if the command-buffer is created
successfully. Otherwise, it returns a `NULL` value with one of the following
error values returned in _errcode_ret_:

* {CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE} if any command-queue in _queues_ is not a valid
  command-queue.

* {CL_INCOMPATIBLE_COMMAND_QUEUE_KHR} if any command-queue in _queues_ is an
  out-of-order command-queue and the device associated with the command-queue
  does not support the {CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_CAPABILITY_OUT_OF_ORDER_KHR}

The function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCommandFillImageKHR.txt[]

Records a command to fill an image object with a specified color.

[NOTE]
====
The usage information which indicates whether the memory object can be read or
written by a kernel and/or the host and is given by the {cl_mem_flags_TYPE} argument
value specified when image is created is ignored by {clCommandFillImageKHR}.
====

_command_buffer_ Refers to a valid command-buffer object.

_command_queue_ Specifies the command-queue the command will be recorded to.
Parameter is unused by this extension as only a single command-queue is

synchronization-points pointed to by _sync_point_wait_list_ must be
valid and _num_sync_points_in_wait_list_ must be greater than 0.
The synchronization-points specified in _sync_point_wait_list_ are

The function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCommandNDRangeKernelKHR.txt[]

Records a command to execute a kernel on a device.

[NOTE]
====
The work-group size to be used for _kernel_ can also be specified in the
program source using the
`+__attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(X, Y, Z)))+` qualifier. In this case the
size of work-group specified by _local_work_size_ must match the value
specified by the `reqd_work_group_size` `+__attribute__+` qualifier.

These work-group instances are executed in parallel across multiple compute
units or concurrently on the same compute unit.

Each work-item is uniquely identified by a global identifier. The global ID,
which can be read inside the kernel, is computed using the value given by
_global_work_size_ and _global_work_offset_. In addition, a work-item is
also identified within a work-group by a unique local ID. The local ID,
which can also be read by the kernel, is computed using the value given by
_local_work_size_. The starting local ID is always (0, 0, ... 0).
====

_command_buffer_ Refers to a valid command-buffer object.

_command_queue_ Specifies the command-queue the command will be recorded to.
Parameter is unused by this extension as only a single command-queue is
supported and **must** be `NULL`.

_properties_ Specifies a list of properties for the kernel command and their
corresponding values. Each property name is immediately followed by the
corresponding desired value. The list is terminated with 0. If no properties are
required, _properties_ may be `NULL`. This extension does not define any
properties.

_kernel_ A valid kernel object which **must** have its arguments set. Any
changes to _kernel_ after calling {clCommandNDRangeKernelKHR}, such as with
{clSetKernelArg} or {clSetKernelExecInfo}, have no effect on the recorded
command. If _kernel_ is recorded to a following {clCommandNDRangeKernelKHR}
command however, then that command will capture the updated state of _kernel_.

_work_dim_, _global_work_offset_, _global_work_size_, _local_work_size_ Refer
to {clEnqueueNDRangeKernel}.

_sync_point_wait_list_, _num_sync_points_in_wait_list_ Specify
synchronization-points that need to complete before this
particular command can be executed.

If _sync_point_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_sync_points_in_wait_list_
must be 0. If _sync_point_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of
synchronization-points pointed to by _sync_point_wait_list_ must be
valid and _num_sync_points_in_wait_list_ must be greater than 0.
The synchronization-points specified in _sync_point_wait_list_ are

synchronization-points that need to complete before this
particular command can be executed.

If _sync_point_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_sync_points_in_wait_list_
must be 0. If _sync_point_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of
synchronization-points pointed to by _sync_point_wait_list_ must be
valid and _num_sync_points_in_wait_list_ must be greater than 0.
The synchronization-points specified in _sync_point_wait_list_ are

with synchronization-points in _sync_point_wait_list_ must be the same
as _command_buffer_. The memory associated with _sync_point_wait_list_

The function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCommandSVMMemFillKHR.txt[]

Records a command to fill a region in SVM with a pattern of a given pattern size.

_command_buffer_ Refers to a valid command-buffer object.

_command_queue_ Specifies the command-queue the command will be recorded to.
Parameter is unused by this extension as only a single command-queue is
supported and **must** be `NULL`.

_svm_ptr_ is a pointer to a (if the device supports system SVM)
or SVM memory region that will be filled with _pattern_. It must be
aligned to _pattern_size_ bytes.
If _svm_ptr_ is allocated using {clSVMAlloc} then it must be allocated from
the same context from which _command_queue_ was created.
Otherwise the behavior is undefined.

_pattern_ is a pointer to the data pattern of size _pattern_size_ in bytes.
_pattern_ will be used to fill a region in _buffer_ starting at _svm_ptr_
and is _size_ bytes in size.
The data pattern must be a scalar or vector integer or floating-point data
type supported by OpenCL.
For example, if region pointed to by _svm_ptr_ is to be filled with a
pattern of float4 values, then _pattern_ will be a pointer to a cl_float4
value and _pattern_size_ will be `sizeof(cl_float4)`.
The maximum value of _pattern_size_ is the size of the largest integer or
floating-point vector data type supported by the OpenCL device.
The memory associated with _pattern_ can be reused or freed after the
function returns.

_size_ is the size in bytes of region being filled starting with _svm_ptr_
and must be a multiple of _pattern_size_.

=== Issues

. Introduce a `clCloneCommandBufferKHR` entry-point for cloning a
  command-buffer.

  on their own internal queue to prevent locking user created queues for the
  duration of their execution.
