Appendix C  Application Data Types
----------------------------------

This section documents the provided host application types and constant
definitions. The documented material describes the commonly defined
data structures, types and constant values available to all platforms
and architectures. The addition of these details demonstrates our
commitment to maintaining a portable programming environment and
potentially deters changes to the supplied headers. 

C.1 Shared Application Scalar Data Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following application scalar types are provided for application
convenience.


cl_char

cl_uchar

cl_short

cl_ushort

cl_int

cl_uint

cl_long

cl_ulong

cl_half

cl_float

cl_double

 

C.2 Supported Application Vector Data Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

Application vector types are unions used to create vectors of the above
application scalar types. The following application vector types are
provided for application convenience.

 

cl_char_n_

cl_uchar_n_

cl_short_n_

cl_ushort_n_

cl_int_n_

cl_uint_n_

cl_long_n_

cl_ulong_n_

cl_half_n_

cl_float_n_

cl_double_n_

 

_n_ can be 2, 3, 4, 8 or 16.

 

The application scalar and vector data types are defined in the
*cl_platform.h* header file.

 

C.3 Alignment of Application Data Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

The user is responsible for ensuring that pointers passed into and out
of OpenCL kernels are natively aligned relative to the data type of the
parameter as defined in the kernel language and SPIR-V specifications.  
This implies that OpenCL buffers created with CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR need
to provide an appropriately aligned host memory pointer that is aligned
to the data types used to access these buffers in a kernel(s), that SVM
allocations must correctly align and that pointers into SVM allocations
must also be correctly aligned. The user is also responsible for
ensuring image data passed is aligned to the granularity of the data
representing a single pixel (e.g. image_num_channels *
sizeof(image_channel_data_type)) except for CL_RGB and CL_RGBx images
where the data must be aligned to the granularity of a single channel in
a pixel (i.e. sizeof(image_channel_data_type)). This implies that OpenCL
images created with CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR must align correctly. The image
alignment value can be queried using the
CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_BASE_ADDRESS_ALIGNMENT query. In addition,

source pointers for clEnqueueWriteImage and other operations that copy
to the OpenCL runtime, as well as destination pointers for
clEnqueueReadImage and other operations that copy from the OpenCL
runtime must follow the same alignment rules.

 

OpenCL makes no requirement about the alignment of OpenCL application
defined data types outside of buffers and images, except that the
underlying vector primitives (e.g. __cl_float4) where defined shall be
directly accessible as such using appropriate named fields in the
cl_type union (see _section C.5_). Nevertheless, it is recommended that
the *cl_platform.h* header should attempt to naturally align OpenCL
defined application data types (e.g. cl_float4) according to their type.



C.4 Vector Literals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Application vector literals may be used in assignments of individual
vector components. Literal usage follows the convention of the
underlying application compiler.

----
cl_float2 foo = { .s[1] = 2.0f };

cl_int8 bar = {{ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 }};
----

C.5 Vector Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The components of application vector types can be addressed using the
<vector_name>.s[<index>] notation.

For example: 

----

foo.s[0] = 1.0f; // Sets the 1st vector component of foo

pos.s[6] = 2; // Sets the 7th vector component of bar
----
 

In some cases vector components may also be accessed using the following
notations. These notations are not guaranteed to be supported on all
implementations, so their use should be accompanied by a check of the
corresponding preprocessor symbol.

 

C.5.1 Named vector components notation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vector data type components may be accessed using the .sN, .sn or .xyzw
field naming convention, similar to how they are used within the OpenCL
language. Use of the .xyzw field naming convention only allows
accessing of the first 4 component fields. Support of these notations
is identified by the CL_HAS_NAMED_VECTOR_FIELDS preprocessor symbol.
For example:


----

#ifdef CL_HAS_NAMED_VECTOR_FIELDS

cl_float4 foo;

cl_int16 bar;

foo.x = 1.0f; // Set first component

foo.s0 = 1.0f; // Same as above

bar.z = 3;  // Set third component

bar.se = 11;  // Same as bar.s[0xe]

bar.sD = 12;  // Same as bar.s[0xd]

#endif

----
 

Unlike the OpenCL language type usage of named vector fields, only one
component field may be accessed at a time. This restriction prevents
the ability to swizzle or replicate components as is possible with the
OpenCL language types. Attempting to access beyond the number of
components for a type also results in a failure. 

----
foo.xy  // illegal - illegal field name combination

bar.s1234 // illegal - illegal field name combination

foo.s7  // illegal - no component s7
----

 

C.5.2 High/Low vector component notation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vector data type components may be accessed using the .hi and .lo
notation similar to that supported within the language types. Support
of this notation is identified by the CL_HAS_HI_LO_VECTOR_FIELDS
preprocessor symbol. For example: 

----
#ifdef CL_HAS_HI_LO_VECTOR_FIELDS

cl_float4 foo;

cl_float2 new_hi = 2.0f, new_lo = 4.0f;

foo.hi = new_hi;

foo.lo = new_lo;

#endif
----

C.5.3 Native vector type notation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Certain native vector types are defined for providing a mapping of
vector types to architecturally builtin vector types. Unlike the above
described application vector types, these native types are supported on
a limited basis depending on the supporting architecture and compiler.

 

These types are not unions, but rather convenience mappings to the
underlying architectures' builtin vector types. The native types share
the name of their application counterparts but are preceded by a double
underscore "__".

 

For example, __cl_float4 is the native builtin vector type equivalent of
the cl_float4 application vector type. The __cl_float4 type may provide
direct access to the architectural builtin __m128 or vector float type,
whereas the cl_float4 is treated as a union.

 

In addition, the above described application data types may have native
vector data type members for access convenience. The native components
are accessed using the .vN sub-vector notation, where N is the number of
elements in the sub-vector. In cases where the native type is a subset
of a larger type (more components), the notation becomes an index based
array of the sub-vector type.

 

Support of the native vector types is identified by a __CL_TYPEN__
preprocessor symbol matching the native type name. For example:

 
----
#ifdef __CL_FLOAT4__ // Check for native cl_float4 type

cl_float8 foo;

__cl_float4 bar; // Use of native type

bar = foo.v4[1]; // Access the second native float4 vector

#endif
----

 

C.6 Implicit Conversions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

Implicit conversions between application vector types are not supported.

 

C.7 Explicit Casts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

Explicit casting of application vector types (cl_typen) is not
supported. Explicit casting of native vector types (__cl_typen) is
defined by the external compiler.

 

 

C.8 Other operators and functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

The behavior of standard operators and function on both application
vector types (cl_typen) and native vector types (__cl_typen) is defined
by the external compiler.

 

C.9 Application constant definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

In addition to the above application type definitions, the following
literal defintions are also available.
