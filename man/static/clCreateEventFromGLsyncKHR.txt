= clCreateEventFromGLsyncKHR(3)

== Name

clCreateEventFromGLsyncKHR - Creates an event object linked to an OpenGL sync object.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
cl_event clCreateEventFromGLsyncKHR(cl_context context,
                                    GLsync sync,
                                    cl_int *errcode_ret)
----

== Parameters

  * _context_ - A valid OpenCL context created from an OpenGL context or
    share group, using the reflink:cl_khr_gl_sharing extension.
  * _sync_ - The name of a sync object in the GL share group associated with
    _context_.
  * _errcode_ret_ - An appropriate error code. If _errcode_ret_ is NULL, no
    error code is returned.

== Description

An event object may be created by linking to an OpenGL sync object.
Completion of such an event object is equivalent to waiting for completion of the fence command associated with the linked GL sync object.

== Notes

The parameters of an event object linked to a GL sync object will return the following values when queried with flink:clGetEventInfo:

  * The `CL_EVENT_COMMAND_QUEUE` of a linked event is NULL, because the event is not associated with any OpenCL command queue.
  * The `CL_EVENT_COMMAND_TYPE` of a linked event is `CL_COMMAND_GL_FENCE_SYNC_OBJECT_KHR`, indicating that the event is associated with a GL sync object, rather than an OpenCL command.
  * The `CL_EVENT_COMMAND_EXECUTION_STATUS` of a linked event is either `CL_SUBMITTED`, indicating that the fence command associated with the sync object has not yet completed, or `CL_COMPLETE`, indicating that the fence command has completed.

`clCreateEventFromGLsyncKHR` performs an implicit flink:clRetainEvent on the returned event object.
Creating a linked event object also places a reference on the linked GL sync object.
When the event object is deleted, the reference will be removed from the GL sync object.

Events returned from `clCreateEventFromGLsyncKHR` can be used in the
_event_wait_list_ argument to flink:clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects and CL APIs
that take a `cl_event` as an argument but do not enqueue commands. Passing
such events to any other CL API that enqueues commands will generate a
`CL_INVALID_EVENT` error.

== Errors

Returns a valid OpenCL event object and _errcode_ret_ is set to `CL_SUCCESS` if the event object is created successfully.
Otherwise, it returns a NULL value with one of the following error values returned in _errcode_ret_:

  * `CL_INVALID_CONTEXT` if _context_ is not a valid context or was not created from a GL context.
  * `CL_INVALID_GL_OBJECT` if _sync_ is not the name of a sync object in the GL share group associated with _context_.
