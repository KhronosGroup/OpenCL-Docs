= cl_khr_gl_sharing(3)

== Name

cl_khr_gl_sharing - Allow applications to use OpenGL buffer, texture and renderbuffer objects as OpenCL image objects.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
cl_khr_gl_sharing
----

== Description

include::gl_sharingInc.txt[]

== Notes

If the reflink:cl_khr_mipmap_image, extension is supported by the OpenCL device, the `cl_khr_gl_sharing` extension adds support for creating a mip-mapped CL image from a mip-mapped GL texture.

To create a mip-mapped CL image from a mip-mapped GL texture, the _miplevel_ argument to flink:clCreateFromGLTexture, should be a negative value.
If _miplevel_ is a negative value then a CL mipmapped image object is created from a mipmapped GL texture object instead of a CL image object for a specific miplevel of a GL texture.

NOTE: For a detailed description of how the level of detail is computed, please refer to section 3.9.7 of the OpenGL 3.0 specification.
