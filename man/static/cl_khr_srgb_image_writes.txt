== Name

cl_khr_srgb_image_writes - Extension allowing writes to sRGB images from a kernel.

== Description

This extensions adds changes to the following:

  * flink:imageFunctions
  * flink:clGetSupportedImageFormats

== See Also

reflink:EXTENSION,
flink:clCreateProgramWithBinary,
flink:clBuildProgram,
flink:clCompileProgram,

== Description

This extension enables kernels to write to sRGB images using the
reflink:imageFunctions[write_imagef] built-in function.
The sRGB image formats that may be written to will be returned by
flink:clGetSupportedImageFormats.

When the image is an sRGB image, the reflink:imageFunctions[write_imagef]
built-in function will perform the linear to sRGB conversion. Only the R, G,
and B components are converted from linear to sRGB; the A component is
written as-is.
