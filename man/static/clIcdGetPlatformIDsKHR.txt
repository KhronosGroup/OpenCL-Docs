= clIcdGetPlatformIDsKHR(3)

== Name

clIcdGetPlatformIDsKHR - Obtain the list of platforms accessible through the Khronos ICD Loader.

[source,c]
----
cl_int clIcdGetPlatformIDsKHR(cl_uint num_entries,
                              cl_platform_id *platforms,
                              cl_uint *num_platforms)
----


== Parameters

  * _num_entries_ - The number of `cl_platform_id` entries that can be added
    to _platforms_. If _platforms_ is not NULL, then _num_entries_ must be
    greater than zero.
  * _platforms_ - Returns a list of OpenCL platforms available for access
    through the Khronos ICD Loader. The `cl_platform_id` values returned in
    _platforms_ are ICD compatible and can be used to identify a specific
    OpenCL platform. If _platforms_ is NULL, then this argument is ignored.
    The number of OpenCL platforms returned is the minimum of the value
    specified by _num_entries_ or the number of OpenCL platforms available.
  * _num_platforms_ - Returns the number of OpenCL platforms available. If
    _num_platforms_ is NULL, then this argument is ignored.

== Notes

This function is enabled by the
reflink:cl_khr_icd extension.

== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully and there are
a non zero number of platforms available, else it returns on the errors
below:

  * `CL_PLATFORM_NOT_FOUND_KHR` if zero platforms are available.
  * `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if _num_entries_ is equal to zero and _platforms_ is not NULL or if both _num_platforms_ and _platforms_ are NULL.
