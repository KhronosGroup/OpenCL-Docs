= clGetDeviceIDsFromD3D11KHR(3)

== Name

clGetDeviceIDsFromD3D11KHR - Querying OpenCL Devices Corresponding to Direct3D 11 Devices.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
cl_int clGetDeviceIDsFromD3D11KHR(cl_platform_id platform,
                                  cl_d3d11_device_source_khr d3d_device_source,
                                  void *d3d_object,
                                  cl_d3d11_device_set_khr d3d_device_set,
                                  cl_uint num_entries,
                                  cl_device_id *devices,
                                  cl_uint *num_devices)
----

== Parameters

  * _platform_ - Refers to the platform ID returned by
    flink:clGetPlatformIDs.
  * _d3d_device_source_ - Specifies the type of _d3d_object_ and may be one
    of the following (Table 9.11.1):
+
--
[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|====
| cl_d3d_device_source_khr    | Type of _d3d_object_
| `CL_D3D11_DEVICE_KHR`       | ID3D11Device *
| `CL_D3D11_DXGI_ADAPTER_KHR` | IDXGIAdapter *
|====
--
  * _d3d_object_ - Specifies the object whose corresponding OpenCL devices
    are being queried. The type of _d3d_object_ must be as specified in the
    table above.
  * _d3d_device_set_ - Specifies the set of devices to return, and must be
    one of the following (Table 9.11.2):
+
--
[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|====
| cl_d3d_device_set_khr | Devices returned in _devices_
| `CL_PREFERRED_DEVICES_FOR_D3D11_KHR`
    | The OpenCL devices associated with the specified Direct3D object.
| `CL_ALL_DEVICES_FOR_D3D11_KHR`
    | All OpenCL devices which may interoperate with the specified Direct3D
      object. Performance of sharing data on these devices may be
      considerably less than on the preferred devices.
|====
--
  * _num_entries_ - The number of `cl_device_id` entries that can be added
    to _devices_. If _devices_ is not NULL, the _num_entries_ must be
    greater than zero.
  * _devices_ - Returns a list of OpenCL devices found. The `cl_device_id`
    values returned in _devices_ can be used to identify a specific OpenCL
    device. If _devices_ is NULL, this argument is ignored. The number of
    OpenCL devices returned is the mininum of the value specified by
    _num_entries_ and the number of OpenCL devices corresponding to
    _d3d_object_.
  * _num_devices_ - Returns the number of OpenCL devices available that
    correspond to _d3d_object_. If _num_devices_ is NULL, this argument is
    ignored.

== Description

The OpenCL devices corresponding to a Direct3D 11 device may be queried.
The OpenCL devices corresponding to a DXGI adapter may also be queried.
The OpenCL devices corresponding to a Direct3D 11 device will be a subset of the OpenCL devices corresponding to the DXGI adapter against which the Direct3D 11 device was created.

== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise it may return:

  * `CL_INVALID_PLATFORM` if _platform_ is not a valid platform.
  * `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if _d3d_device_source_ is not a valid value, _d3d_device_set_ is not a valid value, _num_entries_ is equal to zero and _devices_ is not NULL, or if both _num_devices_ and _devices_ are NULL.
  * `CL_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND` if no OpenCL devices that correspond to _d3d_object_ were found.
