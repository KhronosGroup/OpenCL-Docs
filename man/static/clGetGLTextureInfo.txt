= clGetGLTextureInfo(3)

== Name

clGetGLTextureInfo - Returns additional information about the GL texture object associated with a memory object.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
cl_int clGetGLTextureInfo(cl_mem memobj,
                          cl_gl_texture_info param_name,
                          size_t param_value_size,
                          void *param_value,
                          size_t *param_value_size_ret)
----

== Parameters

  * _memobj_ - An OpenCL memory object handle.
  * _param_name_ - Specifies what additional information about the GL
    texture object associated with _memobj_ to query. The list of supported
    _param_name_ types and the information returned in _param_value_ by
    `clGetGLTextureInfo` is described in the table below (Table 9.5).
  * _param_value_ - A pointer to memory where the result being queried is
    returned. If _param_value_ is NULL, it is ignored.
  * _param_value_size_ - Specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to by
    _param_value_. This size must be {geq} size of return type as described
    in the table below.
  * _param_value_size_ret_ - Returns the actual size in bytes of data copied
    to _param_value_. If _param_value_size_ret_ is NULL, it is ignored.

Table 9.5:

[cols="1a,1a,1a", options="header"]
|====
| cl_gl_texture_info     | Return Type  | Information returned in _param_value_
| `CL_GL_TEXTURE_TARGET` | GLenum
    | The _texture_target_ argument specified in
      flink:clCreateFromGLTexture.
| `CL_GL_MIPMAP_LEVEL`   | GLint
    | The _miplevel_ argument specified in flink:clCreateFromGLTexture.
| `CL_GL_NUM_SAMPLES`    | GLsizei
    | If the reflink:cl_khr_gl_msaa_sharing extension is supported, the
      _samples_ argument passed to `glTexImage2DMultisample` or
      `glTexImage3DMultisample`. If _image_ is not a MSAA texture, 1 is
      returned.

== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * `CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT` if _memobj_ is not a valid OpenCL memory object
  * `CL_INVALID_GL_OBJECT` if there is no GL texture object associated with _memobj_.
  * `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if _param_name_ is not valid, or if size in bytes specified by _param_value_size_ is < size of return type as described in the table above and _param_value_ is not NULL, or if _param_value_ and _param_value_size_ret_ are NULL.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
