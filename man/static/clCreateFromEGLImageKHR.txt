= clCreateFromEGLImageKHR(3)

== Name

clCreateFromEGLImageKHR - Creates an EGLImage target from an EGLImage source.

[source,c]
----
cl_mem clCreateFromEGLImageKHR(cl_context context,
                               CLeglDisplayKHR display,
                               CLeglImageKHR image,
                               cl_mem_flags flags,
                               const cl_egl_image_properties_khr * properties,
                               cl_int * errcode_ret)
----


== Parameters

  * _context_ - A valid OpenCL context.
  * _display_ - Should be of type `EGLDisplay`, cast into the type
    `CLeglDisplayKHR`.
  * _image_ - Should be of type `EGLImageKHR`, cast into the type
    `CLeglImageKHR`. Assuming no errors are generated in this function, the
    resulting image object will be an EGLImage target of the specified
    EGLImage _image_. The resulting `cl_mem` is an image object which may be
    used normally by all OpenCL operations. This maps to an `image2d_t` type
    in OpenCL kernel code.
  * _flags_ -
+
--
A bit-field that is used to specify usage information about the memory
object being created. The possible values for _flags_ are:
`CL_MEM_READ_ONLY`, `CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY` and `CL_MEM_READ_WRITE`.

For OpenCL 1.2 _flags_ also accepts: `CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY`,
`CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY` or `CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS`.

This extension only requires support for `CL_MEM_READ_ONLY`, and for OpenCL
1.2 `CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS`. For OpenCL 1.1, a `CL_INVALID_OPERATION` will
be returned for images which do not support host mapping.

If the value passed in _flags_ is not supported by the OpenCL implementation
it will return `CL_INVALID_VALUE`. The accepted _flags_ may be dependent
upon the texture format used.
--
  * _properties_ - Specifies a list of property names and their
    corresponding values. Each property name is immediately followed by the
    corresponding desired value. The list is terminated with 0. No
    properties are currently supported with this version of the extension.
    _properties_ can be NULL.
  * _errcode_ret_ - An appropriate error code. If _errcode_ret_ is NULL, no
    error code is returned.

== Description

`clCreateFromEGLImageKHR` creates an EGLImage target of type `cl_mem` from
the EGLImage source provided as _image_.

.Lifetime of Shared Objects

An OpenCL memory object created from an EGL image remains valid according to
the lifetime behaviour as described in EGL_KHR_image_base.

"Any EGLImage siblings exist in any client API context"

For OpenCL this means that while the application retains a reference on the
`cl_mem` (EGL sibling), the image remains valid.

.Synchronizing OpenCL and EGL Access to Shared Objects

In order to ensure data integrity, the application is responsible for
synchronizing access to shared CL/EGL objects by their respective APIs.
Failure to provide such synchronization may result in race conditions and
other undefined behavior including non-portability between implementations.

Prior to calling flink:clEnqueueAcquireEGLObjectsKHR, the application must
ensure that any pending operations which access the objects specified in
_mem_objects_ have completed. This may be accomplished in a portable way by
ceasing all client operations on the resource, and issuing and waiting for
completion of a `glFinish` command on all GL contexts with pending
references to these objects. Implementations may offer more efficient
synchronization methods, such as synchronisation primitives or fence
operations.

Similarly, after calling `clEnqueueReleaseEGLImageObjects`, the application
is responsible for ensuring that any pending OpenCL operations which access
the objects specified in _mem_objects_ have completed prior to executing
subsequent commands in other APIs which reference these objects. This may be
accomplished in a portable way by calling flink:clWaitForEvents with
the event object returned by flink:clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects, or by
calling flink:clFinish. As above, some implementations may offer more
efficient methods.

Attempting to access the data store of an EGLImage object after it has been
acquired by OpenCL and before it has been released will result in undefined
behavior. Similarly, attempting to access a shared EGLImage object from
OpenCL before it has been acquired by the OpenCL command-queue or after it
has been released, will result in undefined behavior.

== Errors

  * `CL_INVALID_CONTEXT` if _context_ is not a valid OpenCL context.
  * `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if _properties_ contains invalid values, if _display_
    is not a valid display object or if _flags_ are not in the set defined
    above.
  * `CL_INVALID_EGL_OBJECT_KHR` if _image_ is not a valid EGLImage object.
  * `CL_IMAGE_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED` if the OpenCL implementation is not able
    to create a `cl_mem` compatible with the provided `CLeglImageKHR` for an
    implementation-dependent reason (this could be caused by, but not limited
    to, reasons such as unsupported texture formats, etc).
  * `CL_INVALID_OPERATION` if there are no devices in _context_ that support
    images (i.e. `CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT` specified in table 4.3 (see
    flink:clGetDeviceInfo) is `CL_FALSE`) or if the flags passed are not
    supported for that image type.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
