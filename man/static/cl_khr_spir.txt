== Name

cl_khr_spir - Extension adding support to create an OpenCL program object from a Standard Portable Intermediate Representation (SPIR) instance.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_spir : enable
----

== Description

This extension adds support to create an OpenCL program object from a Standard Portable Intermediate Representation (SPIR) instance.
SPIR is a vendor neutral non-source representation for OpenCL C programs that has since been superceded by the SPIR-V standard.

flink:clCreateProgramWithBinary can be used to load a SPIR binary.
Once a program object has been created from a SPIR binary,
flink:clBuildProgram can be called to build a program executable or
flink:clCompileProgram can be called to compile the SPIR binary.

This extension adds changes to the following:

  * flink:clGetDeviceInfo
  * flink:clGetProgramBuildInfo
  * flink:clGetKernelArgInfo
