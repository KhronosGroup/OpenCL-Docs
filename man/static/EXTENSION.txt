= EXTENSION(3)

== Name

EXTENSION - A #pragma directive to set the behavior for OpenCL extensions.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION extension_name : behavior
#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION all : behavior
----

== Parameters

  * _extension_name_ - The name of the extension. The _extension_name_ will
    have names of the form `cl_khr_`<`name`> for an extension approved by
    the OpenCL working group and will have names of the form
    `cl_`<`vendor_name`>_<`name`> for vendor extensions. The token `all`
    means that the behavior applies to all extensions supported by the
    compiler. The table below shows the legal values for _extension_name_:

  * _behavior_ - One of the following values:

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]

| behavior | Description
| enable
    | Behave as specified by the extension _extension_name_.
      Report an error on the `#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION` if the
      _extension_name_ is not supported, or if `all` is specified.
| disable
    | Behave (including issuing errors and warnings) as if the extension
      _extension_name_ is not part of the language definition.
      If `all` is specified, then behavior must revert back to that of the
      non-extended core version of the language being compiled to. Warn on
      the `#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION` if the extension _extension_name_ is
      not supported.

== Description

The `#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION` directive is a simple, low-level mechanism to set the behavior for each extension.
It does not define policies such as which combinations are appropriate; those must be defined elsewhere.
The order of directives matter in setting the behavior for each extension.
Directives that occur later override those seen earlier.
The `all` variant sets the behavior for all extensions, overriding all
previously issued extension directives, but only if the _behavior_ is set to
`disable`.

The initial state of the compiler is as if the directive `#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION all : disable` was issued, telling the compiler that all error and warning reporting must be done according to this specification, ignoring any extensions.

Every extension which affects the OpenCL language semantics, syntax or adds built-in functions to the language must create a preprocessor `#define` that matches the extension name string.
This `#define` would be available in the language if and only if the extension is supported on a given implementation.

== Notes

This document describes the list of optional features supported by OpenCL 2.1.
Optional extensions may be supported by some OpenCL devices.
Optional extensions are not required to be supported by a conformant OpenCL implementation, but are expected to be widely available; they define functionality that is likely to move into the required feature set in a future revision of the OpenCL specification

OpenCL extensions approved by the OpenCL working group can be promoted to required core features in later revisions of OpenCL.
When this occurs, the extension specifications are merged into the core specification.
Functions and enumerants that are part of such promoted extensions will have the `KHR` affix removed.
OpenCL implementations of such later revisions must also export the name strings of promoted extensions in the `CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS` or `CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS` string, and support the KHR-affixed versions of functions and enumerants as a transition aid.

== Example

An extension which adds the extension string "cl_khr_3d_image_writes" should also add a preprocessor `#define` called `cl_khr_3d_image_writes`.
A kernel can now use this preprocessor `#define` to do something like the following:

[source,c]
----
#ifdef cl_khr_3d_image_writes
    // do something using the extension
#else
    // do something else or #error!
#endif
