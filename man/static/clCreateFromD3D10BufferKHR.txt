= clCreateFromD3D10BufferKHR(3)

== Name

clCreateFromD3D10BufferKHR - Creates an OpenCL buffer object from a Direct3D 10 buffer.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
cl_mem clCreateFromD3D10BufferKHR(cl_context context,
                                  cl_mem_flags flags,
                                  ID3D10Buffer *resource,
                                  cl_int *errcode_ret)
----

== Parameters

  * _context_ - A valid OpenCL context created from a Direct3D 10 device.
  * _flags_ - A bit-field that is used to specify usage information. May be
    `CL_MEM_READ_ONLY`, `CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY`, or `CL_MEM_READ_WRITE`. (See
    the table for flink:clCreateBuffer for more information.)
  * _resource_ - A pointer to the Direct3D 10 buffer to share.
  * _errcode_ret_ - An appropriate error code. If _errcode_ret_ is NULL, no
    error code is returned.

== Notes

The size of the returned OpenCL buffer object is the same as the size of _resource_.
This call will increment the internal Direct3D reference count on _resource_.
The internal Direct3D reference count on _resource_ will be decremented when the OpenCL reference count on the returned OpenCL memory object drops to zero.

== Errors

Returns a valid non-zero OpenCL buffer object and _errcode_ret_ is set to `CL_SUCCESS` if the buffer object is created successfully.
Otherwise, it returns a NULL value with one of the following error values returned in _errcode_ret_:

  * `CL_INVALID_CONTEXT` if _context_ is not a valid context.
  * `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if values specified in _flags_ are not valid.
  * `CL_INVALID_D3D10_RESOURCE_KHR` if _resource_ is not a Direct3D 10 buffer resource, if _resource_ was created with the `D3D10_USAGE` flag `D3D10_USAGE_IMMUTABLE`, if a `cl_mem` from _resource_ has already been created using `clCreateFromD3D10BufferKHR`, or if _context_ was not created against the same Direct3D 10 device from which _resource_ was created.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
