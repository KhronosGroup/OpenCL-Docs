= cl_khr_gl_msaa_sharing(3)

== Name

cl_khr_gl_msaa_sharing - Extends the CL/GL sharing to support GL multi-sampled texture (color or depth).

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_gl_msaa_sharing : enable
----

== Description

This extension name is `cl_khr_gl_msaa_sharing`.
This extension requires reflink:cl_khr_gl_depth_images.

This extension adds read_image and write_image functions to the link:imageFunctions.html[Image Read and Write Functions].

Multi-sample CL image objects (MSAA) can only be read from a kernel.
Multi-sample CL image objects cannot be used as arguments to flink:clEnqueueReadImage ,
flink:clEnqueueWriteImage,
flink:clEnqueueCopyImage,
flink:clEnqueueCopyImageToBuffer,
flink:clEnqueueCopyBufferToImage,
flink:clEnqueueMapImage and
flink:clEnqueueFillImage and will return a `CL_INVALID_OPERATION` error.

Add the following new data types to table 6.3 in section 6.1.3 of the OpenCL 2.1 specification (see reflink:otherDataTypes):

[cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|====
| Type | Description
| `image2d_msaa_t`
    | A 2D multi-sample color image.
      Refer to section 6.13.14 for a detailed description of the built-in functions that use this type.
| `image2d_array_msaa_t`
    | A 2D multi-sample color image array.
      Refer to section 6.13.14 for a detailed description of the built-in functions that use this type.
| `image2d_msaa_depth_t`
    | A 2D multi-sample depth image.
      Refer to section 6.13.14 for a detailed description of the built-in functions that use this type.
| `image2d_array_msaa_depth_t`
    | A 2D multi-sample depth image array.
      Refer to section 6.13.14 for a detailed description of the built-in functions that use this type.
|====

NOTE: When a multisample image is accessed in a kernel, the access takes one
vector of integers describing which pixel to fetch and an integer
corresponding to the sample numbers describing which sample within the pixel
to fetch. _sample_ identifies the sample position in the multi-sample image.

For best performance, we recommend that _sample_ be a literal value so it is
known at compile time and the OpenCL compiler can perform appropriate
optimizations for multisample reads on the device.

No standard sampling instructions are allowed on the multisample image.
Accessing a coordinate outside the image and/or a sample that is outside the number of samples associated with each pixel in the image is undefined
