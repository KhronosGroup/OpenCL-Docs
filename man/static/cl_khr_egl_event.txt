= cl_khr_egl_event(3)

== Name

cl_khr_egl_event - Create CL event objects linked to EGL fence sync objects.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_egl_event : enable
----

== Description

This extension allows creating OpenCL event objects linked to EGL fence sync objects, potentially improving efficiency of sharing images and buffers between the two APIs.
The companion EGL_KHR_cl_event extension provides the complementary functionality of creating an EGL sync object from an OpenCL event object.

If this extension is supported by an implementation, the string `cl_khr_egl_event` will be present in the `CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS` string described in table 4.1 (see flink:clGetPlatformInfo) or `CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS` string described in table 4.3 (see
flink:clGetDeviceInfo).

If the `cl_khr_egl_event` extension is supported, then the following function is enabled:

  * flink:clCreateEventFromEGLSyncKHR

The `cl_khr_egl_event` extension enables changes to the following:

  * flink:clGetEventInfo
  * flink:clWaitForEvents
  * flink:clGetEventInfo
  * flink:clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects
