== Name

cl_khr_throttle_hints - Extension adding throttle hints for OpenCL

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_throttle_hints : enable
----

== Description

This extension adds throttle hints for OpenCL, but does not specify the throttling behaviour or minimum guarantees.
It is expected that the user guide associated with each implementation which supports this extension describe the throttling behaviour guaranteed.

If this extension is supported by an implementation, the string cl_khr_throttle_hints will be present in the `CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS` string described in table 4.1 (see flink:clGetPlatformInfo).

Note that the throttle hint is orthogonal to functionality defined in reflink:cl_khr_priority_hints) extension.
For example, a task may have high priority (`CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH_KHR`) but should at the same time be executed at an optimized throttle setting (`CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_LOW`).
