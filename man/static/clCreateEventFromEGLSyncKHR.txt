= clCreateEventFromEGLSyncKHR(3)

== Name

clCreateEventFromEGLSyncKHR - Creates a linked event object.

[source,c]
----
cl_event clCreateEventFromEGLSyncKHR(cl_context context,
                                     CLeglSyncKHR sync,
                                     CLeglDisplayKHR display,
                                     cl_int *errcode_ret)
----


== Parameters

  * _context_ - A valid OpenCL context created from an OpenGL context or
    share group, using the reflink:cl_khr_gl_sharing extension.
  * _sync_ - The name of a sync object of type `EGL_SYNC_FENCE_KHR` created
    with respect to `EGLDisplay` _display_.
  * _display_ - An `EGLDisplay` handle.

== Description

An event object may be created by linking to an EGL sync object.
Completion of such an event object is equivalent to waiting for completion
of the fence command associated with the linked EGL sync object.


== Notes

The parameters of an event object linked to an EGL sync object will return
the following values when queried with flink:clGetEventInfo:

  * The `CL_EVENT_COMMAND_QUEUE` of a linked event is NULL, because the
    event is not associated with any OpenCL command-queue.
  * The `CL_EVENT_COMMAND_TYPE` of a linked event is
    `CL_COMMAND_EGL_FENCE_SYNC_OBJECT_KHR`, indicating that the event is
    associated with a EGL sync object, rather than an OpenCL command.
  * The `CL_EVENT_COMMAND_EXECUTION_STATUS` of a linked event is either
    `CL_SUBMITTED`, indicating that the fence command associated with the
    sync object has not yet completed, or `CL_COMPLETE`, indicating that the
    fence command has completed.

`clCreateEventFromEGLSyncKHR` performs an implicit flink:clRetainEvent on
the returned event object. Creating a linked event object also places a
reference on the linked EGL sync object. When the event object is deleted,
the reference will be removed from the EGL sync object.

Events returned from `clCreateEventFromEGLSyncKHR` may only be consumed by
`clEnqueueAcquire***` commands. Passing such events to any other OpenCL API
that enqueues commands will generate a `CL_INVALID_EVENT` error."

Event objects can also be used to reflect the status of an EGL fence sync
object. The sync object in turn refers to a fence command executing in an
EGL client API command stream. This provides another method of coordinating
sharing of EGL / EGL client API objects with OpenCL. Completion of EGL / EGL
client API commands may be determined by placing an EGL fence command after
commands using `eglCreateSyncKHR`, creating an event from the resulting EGL
sync object using `clCreateEventFromEGLSyncKHR` and then specifying it in
the _event_wait_list_ of a `clEnqueueAcquire***` command. This method may be
considerably more efficient than calling operations like `glFinish`, and is
referred to as _explicit synchronization_. The application is responsible
for ensuring the command stream associated with the EGL fence is flushed to
ensure the CL queue is submitted to the device. Explicit synchronization is
most useful when an EGL client API context bound to another thread is
accessing the memory objects.


== Errors

Returns a valid OpenCL event object and _errcode_ret_ is set to `CL_SUCCESS`
if the event object is created successfully.
Otherwise, it returns a NULL value with one of the following error values
returned in _errcode_ret_:

  * `CL_INVALID_CONTEXT` if _context_ is not a valid context or was not
    created from a GL context.
  * `CL_INVALID_EGL_OBJECT_KHR` if _sync_ is not a valid EGLSyncKHR handle
    created with respect to `EGLDisplay` _display_.
  * `CL_INVALID_EGL_OBJECT_KHR` if _sync_ is not a valid EGLSyncKHR object
    of type `EGL_SYNC_FENCE_KHR` created with respect to `EGLDisplay`
    _display_.
