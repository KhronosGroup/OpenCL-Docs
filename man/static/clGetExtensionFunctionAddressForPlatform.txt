= clGetExtensionFunctionAddressForPlatform(3)

== Name

clGetExtensionFunctionAddressForPlatform - Returns the address of the extension function named by _funcname_ for a given _platform_.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
void* clGetExtensionFunctionAddressForPlatform(cl_platform_id platform,
                                               const char *funcname)
----

== Parameters

  * _platform_ - Refers to the platform ID returned by
    flink:clGetPlatformIDs.
  * _funcname_ - Name of an extension function.

== Description

The function `clGetExtensionFunctionAddressForPlatform` returns the address of the extension function named by _funcname_ for a given _platform_.
The pointer returned should be cast to a function pointer type matching the extension function's definition defined in the appropriate extension specification and header file.

A return value of NULL indicates that the specified function does not exist for the implementation or _platform_ is not a valid platform.
A non-NULL return value for `clGetExtensionFunctionAddressForPlatform` does not guarantee that an extension function is actually supported by the platform.
The application must also make a corresponding query using flink:clGetPlatformInfo (platform, `CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS`, ... ) or
flink:clGetDeviceInfo (device,`CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS`, ... ) to determine if an extension is supported by the OpenCL implementation.

`clGetExtensionFunctionAddressForPlatform` may not be queried for core (non-extension) functions in OpenCL.
For functions that are queryable with `clGetExtensionFunctionAddressForPlatform`, implementations may choose to also export those functions statically from the object libraries implementing those functions.
However, portable applications cannot rely on this behavior.

Function pointer typedefs must be declared for all extensions that add API entrypoints.
These typedefs are a required part of the extension interface, to be provided in an appropriate header (such as `cl_ext.h` if the extension is an OpenCL extension, or `cl_gl_ext.h` if the extension is an OpenCL/OpenGL sharing extension).

== Notes

Since there is no way to qualify the query with a device, the function pointer returned must work for all implementations of that extension on different devices for a platform.
The behavior of calling a device extension function on a device not supporting that extension is undefined.

If the reflink:cl_khr_icd extension is enabled, for functions supported by the ICD Loader, `clGetExtensionFunctionAddress` will return the function pointer of the ICD Loader implementation.
For extension functions which the ICD Loader is unaware of, the function `clGetExtensionFunctionAddress` will determine the vendor implementation to return based on the string passed in.
The ICD Loader will return the result from querying `clGetExtensionFunctionAddress` on the vendor ICD enumerated by the ICD Loader whose ICD suffix is a suffix of the function name being queried.
If no such vendor exists or the suffix of the function is `KHR` or `EXT` then `clGetExtensionFunctionAddress` will return NULL.

== Example

The following convention must be followed for all extensions affecting the host API, where TAG can be `KHR`, `EXT` or vendor-specific:

[source,c]
----
#ifndef extension_name
#define extension_name       1

// all data typedefs, token #defines, prototypes, and
// function pointer typedefs for this extension

// function pointer typedefs must use the
// following naming convention
typedef return type
      (CL_API_CALL *clextension_func_nameTAG_fn)(...);

#endif // extension_name
----

Consider, for example, the reflink:cl_khr_gl_sharing extension.
This extension would add the following to `cl_gl_ext.h`:

[source,c]
----
#ifndef cl_khr_gl_sharing
#define cl_khr_gl_sharing     1

// all data typedefs, token #defines, prototypes, and
// function pointer typedefs for this extension
#define CL_INVALID_GL_SHAREGROUP_REFERENCE_KHR -1000
#define CL_CURRENT_DEVICE_FOR_GL_CONTEXT_KHR   0x2006
#define CL_DEVICES_FOR_GL_CONTEXT_KHR          0x2007
#define CL_GL_CONTEXT_KHR                      0x2008
#define CL_EGL_DISPLAY_KHR                     0x2009
#define CL_GLX_DISPLAY_KHR                     0x200A
#define CL_WGL_HDC_KHR                         0x200B
#define CL_CGL_SHAREGROUP_KHR                  0x200C

// function pointer typedefs must use the
// following naming convention
typedef cl_int
     (CL_API_CALL *clGetGLContextInfoKHR_fn)(
              const cl_context_properties * /* properties */,
              cl_gl_context_info /* param_name */,
              size_t /* param_value_size */,
              void * /* param_value */,
              size_t * /_param_value_size_ret_/);
#endif // cl_khr_gl_sharing
