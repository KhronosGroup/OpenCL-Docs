== Name

cl_khr_priority_hints - Extension adding priority hints for OpenCL

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_priority_hints : enable
----

== Description

This extension adds priority hints for OpenCL, but does not specify the scheduling behavior or minimum guarantees.
It is expected that the the user guides associated with each implementation which supports this extension describe the scheduling behavior guaranteed.

If this extension is supported by an implementation, the string cl_khr_priority_hints will be present in the `CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS` string described in table 4.1 (see flink:clGetPlatformInfo).
