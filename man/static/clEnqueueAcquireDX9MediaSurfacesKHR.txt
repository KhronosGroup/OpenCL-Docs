= clEnqueueAcquireDX9MediaSurfacesKHR(3)

== Name

clEnqueueAcquireDX9MediaSurfacesKHR - Acquire OpenCL memory objects that have been created from a media surface.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
cl_int clEnqueueAcquireDX9MediaSurfacesKHR(cl_command_queue command_queue,
                                           cl_uint num_objects,
                                           const cl_mem *mem_objects,
                                           cl_uint num_events_in_wait_list,
                                           const cl_event *event_wait_list,
                                           cl_event *event)
----

== Parameters

  * _command_queue_ - A valid command-queue.
  * _num_objects_ - The number of memory objects to be acquired in
    _mem_objects_.
  * _mem_objects_ - A pointer to a list of OpenCL memory objects that were
    created from media surfaces.
  * _num_events_in_wait_list_ - Number of events in _event_wait_list_.
  * _event_wait_list_ - Specify events that need to complete before this
    particular command can be executed. If _event_wait_list_ is NULL, then
    this particular command does not wait on any event to complete. If
    _event_wait_list_ is NULL, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0. If
    _event_wait_list_ is not NULL, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0. The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as
    synchronization points.
  * _event_ - Returns an event object that identifies this particular
    command and can be used to query or queue a wait for this particular
    command to complete. _event_ can be NULL in which case it will not be
    possible for the application to query the status of this command or
    queue a wait for this command to complete. If _event_wait_list_ and
    _event_ are not NULL, _event_ should not refer to an element of the
    _event_wait_list_ array.

== Notes

Used to acquire OpenCL memory objects that have been created from a media surface.
The media surfaces are acquired by the OpenCL context associated with _command_queue_ and can therefore be used by all command-queues associated with the OpenCL context.

OpenCL memory objects created from media surfaces must be acquired before they can be used by any OpenCL commands queued to a command-queue.
If an OpenCL memory object created from a media surface is used while it is not currently acquired by OpenCL, the call attempting to use that OpenCL memory object will return `CL_DX9_MEDIA_SURFACE_NOT_ACQUIRED_KHR`.

If `CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC` is not specified as `CL_TRUE` during context creation, `clEnqueueAcquireDX9MediaSurfacesKHR` provides the synchronization guarantee that any media adapter API calls involving the interop device(s) used in the OpenCL context made before `clEnqueueAcquireDX9MediaSurfacesKHR` is called will complete executing before _event_ reports completion and before the execution of any subsequent OpenCL work issued in _command_queue_ begins.
If the context was created with properties specifying `CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC` as `CL_TRUE`, the user is responsible for guaranteeing that any media adapter API calls involving the interop device(s) used in the OpenCL context made before `clEnqueueAcquireDX9MediaSurfacesKHR` is called have completed before calling `clEnqueueAcquireDX9MediaSurfacesKHR`.

== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
If _num_objects_ is 0 and _mem_objects_ is NULL then the function does nothing and returns `CL_SUCCESS`.
Otherwise it returns one of the following errors:

  * `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if _num_objects_ is zero and _mem_objects_ is not a NULL value or if _num_objects_ > 0 and _mem_objects_ is NULL.
  * `CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT` if memory objects in _mem_objects_ are not valid OpenCL memory objects or if memory objects in _mem_objects_ have not been created from media surfaces.
  * `CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE` if _command_queue_ is not a valid command-queue.
  * `CL_INVALID_CONTEXT` if context associated with _command_queue_ was not created from a device that can share the media surface referenced by _mem_objects_.
  * `CL_DX9_MEDIA_SURFACE_ALREADY_ACQUIRED_KHR` if memory objects in _mem_objects_ have previously been acquired using `clEnqueueAcquireDX9MediaSurfacesKHR` but have not been released using flink:clEnqueueReleaseDX9MediaSurfacesKHR.
  * `CL_INVALID_EVENT_WAIT_LIST` if _event_wait_list_ is NULL and `num_event_in_wait_list` > 0, or _event_wait_list_ is not NULL and `num_event_in_wait_list` is 0, or if event objects in _event_wait_list_ are not valid events.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
