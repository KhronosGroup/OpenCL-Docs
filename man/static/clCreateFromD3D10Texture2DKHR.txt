= clCreateFromD3D10Texture2DKHR(3)

== Name

clCreateFromD3D10Texture2DKHR - Creates an OpenCL 2D image object from a subresource of a Direct3D 10 2D texture.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
cl_mem clCreateFromD3D10Texture2DKHR(cl_context context,
                                     cl_mem_flags flags,
                                     ID3D10Texture2D *resource,
                                     UINT subresource,
                                     cl_int *errcode_ret)
----

== Parameters

  * _context_ - A valid OpenCL context created from a Direct3D 10 device.
  * _flags_ - A bit-field that is used to specify usage information. May be
    `CL_MEM_READ_ONLY`, `CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY`, or `CL_MEM_READ_WRITE`. (See
    the table for flink:clCreateBuffer for more information.)
  * _resource_ - A pointer to the Direct3D 10 2D texture to share.
  * _subresource_ - The subresource of _resource_ to share.
  * _errcode_ret_ - An appropriate error code. If _errcode_ret_ is NULL, no
    error code is returned.

== Notes

The width, height and depth of the returned OpenCL 2D image object are determined by the width, height and depth of subresource _subresource_ of _resource_.
The channel type and order of the returned OpenCL 2D image object is determined by the format of _resource_ as shown in of Direct3D 10 and corresponding OpenCL image formats of _resource_ in flink:clCreateFromD3D10Texture3DKHR.

This call will increment the internal Direct3D reference count on _resource_.
The internal Direct3D reference count on _resource_ will be decremented when the OpenCL reference count on the returned OpenCL memory object drops to zero.

== Errors

Returns a valid non-zero OpenCL image object and _errcode_ret_ is set to `CL_SUCCESS` if the image object is created successfully.
Otherwise, it returns a NULL value with one of the following error values returned in _errcode_ret_:

  * `CL_INVALID_CONTEXT` if _context_ is not a valid context.
  * `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if values specified in _flags_ are not valid or if _subresource_ is not a valid subresource index for _resource_.
  * `CL_INVALID_D3D10_RESOURCE_KHR` if _resource_ is not a Direct3D 10 texture resource, if _resource_ was created with the `D3D10_USAGE` flag `D3D10_USAGE_IMMUTABLE`, if a _resource_ is a multisampled texture, if a `cl_mem` from subresource _subresource_ of _resource_ has already been created using `clCreateFromD3D10Texture2DKHR`, or if _context_ was not created against the same Direct3D 10 device from which _resource_ was created.
  * `CL_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT_DESCRIPTOR` if the Direct3D 10 texture format of _resource_ is not a value listed in the table of Direct3D 10 and corresponding OpenCL image formats for flink:clCreateFromD3D10Texture3DKHR, or if the Direct3D 10 texture format of _resource_ does not map to a supported OpenCL image format.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
