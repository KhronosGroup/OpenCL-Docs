= clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects(3)

== Name

clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects - Acquire OpenCL memory objects that have been created from OpenGL objects.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
cl_int clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects(cl_command_queue command_queue,
                                 cl_uint num_objects,
                                 const cl_mem *mem_objects,
                                 cl_uint num_events_in_wait_list,
                                 const cl_event *event_wait_list,
                                 cl_event *event)
----

== Parameters

  * _command_queue_ - A valid command-queue. All devices used to create the
    OpenCL context associated with _command_queue_ must support acquiring
    shared CL/GL objects. This constraint is enforced at context creation
    time.
  * _num_objects_ - The number of memory objects to be acquired in
    _mem_objects_.
  * _mem_objects_ - A pointer to a list of CL memory objects that correspond
    to GL objects.
  * _num_events_in_wait_list_ - Number of events in _event_wait_list_.
  * _event_wait_list_ - Specify events that need to complete before this
    particular command can be executed. If _event_wait_list_ is NULL, then
    this particular command does not wait on any event to complete. If
    _event_wait_list_ is NULL, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0. If
    _event_wait_list_ is not NULL, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0. The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as
    synchronization points.
  * _event_ - Returns an event object that identifies this command and can
    be used to query or queue a wait for the command to complete. _event_
    can be NULL in which case it will not be possible for the application to
    query the status of this command or queue a wait for this command to
    complete. If _event_wait_list_ and _event_ are not NULL, _event_ should
    not refer to an element of the _event_wait_list_ array.

--
If the reflink:cl_khr_gl_event extension is supported, if an OpenGL context
is bound to the current thread, then any OpenGL commands which

  * affect or access the contents of a memory object listed in the
    _mem_objects_ list, and
  * were issued on that OpenGL context prior to the call to
    `clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects`

will complete before execution of any OpenCL commands following the
`clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects` which affect or access any of those memory
objects. If a non-NULL event object is returned, it will report completion
only after completion of such OpenGL commands.

If the reflink:cl_khr_egl_event extension is supported, prior to calling
`clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects`, the application must ensure that any pending
EGL or EGL client API operations which access the objects specified in
_mem_objects_ have completed.
--

== Description

These objects need to be acquired before they can be used by any OpenCL commands queued to a command-queue.
The OpenGL objects are acquired by the OpenCL context associated with _command_queue_ and can therefore be used by all command-queues associated with the OpenCL context.

== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
If _num_objects_ is 0 and _mem_objects_ is NULL the function does nothing and returns `CL_SUCCESS`.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if _num_objects_ is zero and _mem_objects_ is not a NULL value or if _num_objects_ > 0 and _mem_objects_ is NULL.
  * `CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT` if memory objects in _mem_objects_ are not valid OpenCL memory objects.
  * `CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE` if _command_queue_ is not a valid command-queue.
  * `CL_INVALID_CONTEXT` if context associated with _command_queue_ was not created from an OpenGL context.
  * `CL_INVALID_GL_OBJECT` if memory objects in _mem_objects_ have not been created from a GL object(s).
  * `CL_INVALID_EVENT_WAIT_LIST` if _event_wait_list_ is NULL and _num_events_in_wait_list_ > 0, or _event_wait_list_ is not NULL and _num_events_in_wait_list_ is 0, or if event objects in _event_wait_list_ are not valid events.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
