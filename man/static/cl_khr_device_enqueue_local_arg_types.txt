= cl_khr_device_enqueue_local_arg_types(3)

== Name

cl_khr_device_enqueue_local_arg_types - Allows arguments to blocks passed to enqueue_kernel functions to be declared as a pointer to any type in local memory.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_device_enqueue_local_arg_types : enable
----

== Description

This extension allows arguments to blocks passed to enqueue_kernel functions to be declared as a pointer to any type (built-in or user-defined) in local memory instead of just `local void *`.

If this extension is supported by an implementation, the string cl_khr_device_enqueue_local_arg_types will be present in the `CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS` string described in table 4.3 (see flink:clGetDeviceInfo).
