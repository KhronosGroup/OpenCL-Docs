= clGetGLContextInfoKHR(3)

== Name

clGetGLContextInfoKHR - Get OpenGL context information.

[source,c]
----
cl_int clGetGLContextInfoKHR(const cl_context_properties *properties,
                             cl_gl_context_info param_name,
                             size_t param_value_size,
                             void *param_value,
                             size_t *param_value_size_ret)
----


== Parameters

  * _properties_ - Points to an attribute list whose format and valid
    contents are identical to the _properties_ argument of
    flink:clCreateContext. _properties_ must identify a single valid GL
    context or GL share group object.
  * _param_name_ - A constant that specifies the GL context information to
    query, and must be one of the values shown in the table below.
  * _param_value_size_ - Specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to by
    _param_value_. This size must be greater than or equal to the size of
    the return type described in the table below.
  * _param_value_ - A pointer to memory where the result of the query is
    returned as described in the table below. If _param_value_ is NULL, it
    is ignored.
  * _param_value_size_ret_ - Returns the actual size in bytes of data being
    queried by _param_value_. If _param_value_size_ret_ is NULL, it is
    ignored.

== Description

Get OpenGL context information.

[cols="1a,1a,1a", options="header"]
|===
| _param_name_                           | Return Type    | Information returned in param_value
| `CL_CURRENT_DEVICE_FOR_GL_CONTEXT_KHR` | `cl_device_id`
    | Return the CL device currently associated with the specified OpenGL context.
| `CL_DEVICES_FOR_GL_CONTEXT_KHR`        | `cl_device_id[]`
    | List of all CL devices which may be associated with the specified OpenGL context.

== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully. If no
device(s) exist corresponding to _param_name_, the call will not fail, but
the value of _param_value_size_ret_ will be zero. Otherwise returns one of
the following:

  * {blank}
+
--
`CL_INVALID_GL_SHAREGROUP_REFERENCE_KHR` if a context was specified by any
of the following means:

  * A context was specified for an EGL-based OpenGL ES or OpenGL implementation by setting the attributes `CL_GL_CONTEXT_KHR` and `CL_EGL_DISPLAY_KHR`
  * A context was specified for a GLX-based OpenGL implementation by setting the attributes `CL_GL_CONTEXT_KHR` and `CL_GLX_DISPLAY_KHR`
  * A context was specified for a WGL-based OpenGL implementation by setting the attributes `CL_GL_CONTEXT_KHR` and `CL_WGL_HDC_KHR`

and any of the following conditions hold:

  * The specified display and context attributes do not identify a valid OpenGL or OpenGL ES context.
  * The specified context does not support buffer and renderbuffer objects.
  * The specified context is not compatible with the OpenCL context being created (for example, it exists in a physically distinct address space, such as another hardware device; or it does not support sharing data with OpenCL due to implementation restrictions).
--
  * `CL_INVALID_GL_SHAREGROUP_REFERENCE_KHR` if a share group was specified
    for a CGL-based OpenGL implementation by setting the attribute
    `CL_CGL_SHAREGROUP_KHR`, and the specified share group does not identify a
    valid CGL share group object.

  * {blank}
+
--
`CL_INVALID_OPERATION` if a context was specified as described above and any of the following conditions hold:

  * A context or share group object was specified for one of CGL, EGL, GLX, or WGL and the OpenGL implementation does not support that window-system binding API.
  * More than one of the attributes `CL_CGL_SHAREGROUP_KHR`, `CL_EGL_DISPLAY_KHR`, `CL_GLX_DISPLAY_KHR`, and `CL_WGL_HDC_KHR` is set to a non-default value.
  * Both of the attributes `CL_CGL_SHAREGROUP_KHR` and `CL_GL_CONTEXT_KHR` are set to non-default values.
  * Any of the devices specified in _devices_ cannot support OpenCL objects which share the data store of an OpenGL object.
--
  * `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if an attribute name other than those specified in
    the table of supported _properties_ for flink:clCreateContext,
  * `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if _param_name_ is not one of the values listed in
    the table above; or if the size in bytes specified by _param_value_size_
    is less than the size of the return type shown in the table above, and
    _param_value_ is not a NULL value.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the device
  * `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
