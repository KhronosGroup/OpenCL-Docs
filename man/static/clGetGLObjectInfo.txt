= clGetGLObjectInfo(3)

== Name

clGetGLObjectInfo - Query an OpenGL object used to create an OpenCL memory object.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
cl_int clGetGLObjectInfo(cl_mem memobj,
                         cl_gl_object_type *gl_object_type,
                         GLuint *gl_object_name)
----

== Parameters

  * _memobj_ - An OpenCL memory object handle.
  * _gl_object_type_ - Returns the type of GL object attached to _memobj_
    and can be `CL_GL_OBJECT_BUFFER`, `CL_GL_OBJECT_TEXTURE2D`,
    `CL_GL_OBJECT_TEXTURE3D`, `CL_GL_OBJECT_TEXTURE2D_ARRAY`,
    `CL_GL_OBJECT_TEXTURE1D`, `CL_GL_OBJECT_TEXTURE1D_ARRAY`,
    `CL_GL_OBJECT_TEXTURE_BUFFER`, or `CL_GL_OBJECT_RENDERBUFFER`. If
    _gl_object_type_ is NULL, it is ignored.
  * _gl_object_name_ - Returns the GL object name used to create _memobj_.
    If _gl_object_name_ is NULL, it is ignored.

== Description

The OpenGL object used to create the OpenCL memory object and information about the object type i.e.
whether it is a texture, renderbuffer, or buffer object can be queried using this function.

== Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the call was executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * `CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT` if _memobj_ is not a valid OpenCL memory object.
  * `CL_INVALID_GL_OBJECT` if there is no GL object associated with _memobj_.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
