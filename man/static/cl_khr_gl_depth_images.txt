== Name

cl_khr_gl_depth_images - Extends CL/GL sharing to allow a CL image to be created from a GL depth or depth-stencil texture.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_gl_depth_images : enable
----

== Description

The `cl_khr_gl_depth_images` extension extends CL / GL sharing (i.e.
the reflink:cl_khr_gl_sharing extension) defined in section 9.7 to allow a CL depth image to be created from a GL depth or depth-stencil texture.
If this extension is supported by an implementation, the string cl_khr_gl_depth_images will be present in the `CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS` string described in table 4.1 or `CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS` string described in table 4.3.

Depth images with an image channel order of `CL_DEPTH_STENCIL` can only be created using the flink:clCreateFromGLTexture API.

For the image format given by channel order of `CL_DEPTH_STENCIL` and channel data type of `CL_UNORM_INT24`, the depth is stored as an unsigned normalized 24-bit value.

For the image format given by channel order of `CL_DEPTH_STENCIL` and channel data type of `CL_FLOAT`, each pixel is two 32-bit values.
The depth is stored as a single precision floating-point value followed by the stencil which is stored as a 8-bit integer value.

The stencil value cannot be read or written using the read imagef and write imagef built-in functions in an OpenCL kernel.

Depth image objects with an image channel order = `CL_DEPTH_STENCIL` cannot be used as arguments to flink:clEnqueueReadImage,
flink:clEnqueueWriteImage,
flink:clEnqueueCopyImage,
flink:clEnqueueCopyImageToBuffer,
flink:clEnqueueCopyBufferToImage,
flink:clEnqueueMapImage and
flink:clEnqueueFillImage and will return a `CL_INVALID_OPERATION` error.

The following new image formats are added to table 9.4 in section 9.7.3.1 of the OpenCL 2.1 extension specification.
If a GL texture object with an internal format from table 9.4 is successfully created by OpenGL, then there is guaranteed to be a mapping to one of the corresponding CL image format(s) in that table.
