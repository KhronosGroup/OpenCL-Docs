== Name

cl_khr_mipmap_image - Extension adding support for mipmaps.

== C Specification

[source,c]
----
#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_mipmap_image : enable

#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_mipmap_image_writes : enable
----

== Description

This extension adds support for mipmaps.
This proposal is implemented as two optional extensions.
The `cl_khr_mipmap_image` extension implements support to create a mipmapped image, enqueue commands to read/write/copy/map a region of a mipmapped image and built-in functions that can be used to read a mip-mapped image in an OpenCL C program.
The `cl_khr_mipmap_image_writes` extension adds built-in functions that can be used to write a mip-mapped image in an OpenCL C program.
If the `cl_khr_mipmap_image_writes` extension is supported by the OpenCL device, the `cl_khr_mipmap_image` extension must also be supported.

This extension enables the following functions:

  * reflink:get_image_num_mip_levels

This extension enables changes to the following:

  * flink:clCreateImage
  * flink:clEnqueueReadImage
  * flink:clEnqueueWriteImage
  * flink:clEnqueueMapImage
  * flink:clEnqueueCopyImage
  * flink:clEnqueueCopyImageToBuffer
  * flink:clEnqueueCopyBufferToImage
  * flink:clCreateSamplerWithProperties
  * flink:imageReadFunctions
  * flink:imageWriteFunctions
  * reflink:cl_khr_gl_sharing
  * flink:clCreateFromGLTexture
