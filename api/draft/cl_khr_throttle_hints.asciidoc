=== Host-Side API Modifications

The function {clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties} (Section 5.1) is extended
to support a new {CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_KHR} value as part of the _properties_
argument.

The properties field accepts the following values:

  * {CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_HIGH_KHR} (full throttle, i.e., OK to consume more
    energy)
  * {CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_MED_KHR} (normal throttle)
  * {CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_LOW_KHR} (optimized/lowest energy consumption)

If {CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_KHR} is not specified, then the default priority is
{CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_MED_KHR}.

To the error section for {clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties}, the following
is added:

  * {CL_INVALID_QUEUE_PROPERTIES} if the {CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_KHR} property is
    specified and the queue is a {CL_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE}.
