This directory, 'api/draft/Snapshot/', contains copies of files from
OpenCL-Docs/ext/cl*asciidoc (../../ext) as of the versions used to merge
into the spec.

They are not modified at all, so that diffs from later changes to the
extensions can be found and incorporated.

When this is done, this copy should be updated as well as the corresponding
rough spec markup in 'api/draft/'
