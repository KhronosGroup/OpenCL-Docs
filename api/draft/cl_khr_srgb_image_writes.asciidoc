=== Description

`cl_khr_srgb_image_writes` enables kernels to write to sRGB images using the
*write_imagef* built-in function.
The sRGB image formats that may be written to will be returned by
{clGetSupportedImageFormats}.

When the image is an sRGB image, the *write_imagef* built-in function will
perform the linear to sRGB conversion.
Only the R, G, and B components are converted from linear to sRGB; the A
component is written as-is.
