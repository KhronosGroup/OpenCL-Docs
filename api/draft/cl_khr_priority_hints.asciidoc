=== Host-Side API Modifications

The function {clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties} (Section 5.1) is extended
to support a priority value as part of the _properties_ argument.

The priority property applies to OpenCL command-queues that belong to the
same OpenCL context.

The properties field accepts the {CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_KHR} property, with a
value of type {cl_queue_priority_khr_TYPE}, which can be one of:

  * {CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH_KHR}
  * {CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_MED_KHR}
  * {CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW_KHR}

If {CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_KHR} is not specified then the default priority is
{CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_MED_KHR}.

To the error section for {clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties}, the following
is added:

  * {CL_INVALID_QUEUE_PROPERTIES} if the {CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_KHR} property is
    specified and the queue is a {CL_QUEUE_ON_DEVICE}.
