This directory, 'api/draft/', contains rough drafts of extension specs
sliced and diced for inclusion in the API and C language specs.\

As lines are merged into those specs, they are prefixed 'OK> ' in this file.
When finished, or nearly so, a brief note is added at the top of each draft
to indicate this and it is moved into 'api/Done/'.
