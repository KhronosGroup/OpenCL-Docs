=== Description

{cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing_EXT} allows applications to use media surfaces as
OpenCL memory objects.
This allows efficient sharing of data between OpenCL and selected adapter
APIs (only DX9 for now).
If this extension is supported, an OpenCL image object can be created from a
media surface and the OpenCL API can be used to execute kernels that read
and/or write memory objects that are media surfaces.
Note that OpenCL memory objects may be created from the adapter media
surface if and only if the OpenCL context has been created from that
adapter.
