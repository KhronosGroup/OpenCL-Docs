=== Description

{cl_ext_immutable_memory_objects_EXT} provides a mechanism to create memory
objects that cannot be modified by the implementation after creation. This,
for example, enables implementation to support image formats for which no write
operations can be supported.

=== New Enums

  * {cl_mem_flags_TYPE}
  ** {CL_MEM_IMMUTABLE_EXT}

=== Issues

1) Can {CL_MEM_READ_ONLY} be used instead of {CL_MEM_IMMUTABLE_EXT}?
--
*RESOLVED*: No. Memory objects created with {CL_MEM_READ_ONLY} can be modified
by copy or fill commands and this behaviour cannot be changed without breaking
backwards compatibility.
