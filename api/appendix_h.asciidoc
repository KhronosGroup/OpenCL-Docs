= OpenCL 3.0 Backwards Compatibility

OpenCL 3.0 breaks backwards compatibility with earlier versions of OpenCL by making some features that were previously required for FULL_PROFILE or EMBEDDED_PROFILE devices optional.
This appendix describes the features that were previously required that are now optional, how to detect whether an optional feature is supported, and expected behavior when an optional feature is not supported.

NOTE: Informally, in the tables below the first row usually describes a feature detection mechanism ("May return this value indicating that the feature is not supported") and subsequent rows usually describe behavior when a feature is not supported ("Returns this value if the feature is not supported").

== Shared Virtual Memory

Shared Virtual Memory (SVM) is optional for devices supporting OpenCL 3.0.
When Shared Virtual Memory is not supported:

[cols="2,3",options="header",]
|====
|*API*
|*Behavior*

| {clGetDeviceInfo}, passing +
{CL_DEVICE_SVM_CAPABILITIES}
| May return `0`, indicating that _device_ does not support Shared Virtual Memory.

| {clGetMemObjectInfo}, passing +
{CL_MEM_USES_SVM_POINTER}
| Returns {CL_FALSE} if no devices in the context associated with _memobj_ support Shared Virtual Memory.

| {clSVMAlloc}
| Returns `NULL` if no devices in _context_ support Shared Virtual Memory.

| {clSVMFree}
| Is a NOP if no devices in _context_ support Shared Virtual Memory.

| {clEnqueueSVMFree}, +
  {clEnqueueSVMMemcpy}, +
  {clEnqueueSVMMemFill}, +
  {clEnqueueSVMMap}, +
  {clEnqueueSVMUnmap}, +
  {clEnqueueSVMMigrateMem}
| Returns {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if the device associated with _command_queue_ does not support Shared Virtual Memory.

| {clSetKernelArgSVMPointer}, +
  {clSetKernelExecInfo}
| Returns {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if no devices in the context associated with _kernel_ support Shared Virtual Memory.

|====

== Memory Consistency Model

Some aspects of the OpenCL memory consistency model are optional for devices supporting OpenCL 3.0.
New device queries were added to {clGetDeviceInfo} to allow capabilities to be precisely reported.
When the full memory consistency model is not supported:

[cols="2,3",options="header",]
|====
|*API*
|*Behavior*

| {clGetDeviceInfo}, passing +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_MEMORY_CAPABILITIES}
| May return:

{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_RELAXED} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_WORK_GROUP}

indicating that _device_ does not support the full memory consistency model for atomic memory operations.

// The above is based on mapping OpenCL 1.x atomic operations to 2.x as:
// atomic_add(ptr, operand) --> atomic_fetch_add_explicit(ptr, operand,
//                                                        memory_order_relaxed,
//                                                        memory_scope_work_group)
// The scope is inconsequential for relaxed consistency order, but in general
// in OpenCL 1.x non-atomic memory operations are only guaranteed to be visible
// within the work-group (until the work-group completes).

Note that a device that provides the same level of capabilities as an OpenCL 2.x device would be expected to return:

{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_RELAXED} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_ACQ_REL} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_SEQ_CST} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_WORK_GROUP} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_DEVICE} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_ALL_DEVICES}

| {clGetDeviceInfo}, passing +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_FENCE_CAPABILITIES}
| May return:

{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_RELAXED} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_ACQ_REL} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_WORK_GROUP}

indicating that _device_ does not support the full memory consistency model for atomic fence operations.

// The above is based on mapping OpenCL 1.x fences to 2.x fences as:
// mem_fence(flags) --> atomic_work_item_fence(flags,
//                                             memory_order_acq_rel,
//                                             memory_scope_work_group)
// read_mem_fence(flags) --> atomic_work_item_fence(flags,
//                                                  memory_order_acquire,
//                                                  memory_scope_work_group)
// write_mem_fence(flags) --> atomic_work_item_fence(flags,
//                                                   memory_order_release,
//                                                   memory_scope_work_group)

Note that a device that provides the same level of capabilities as an OpenCL 2.x device would be expected to return:

{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_RELAXED} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_ACQ_REL} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_SEQ_CST} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_WORK_ITEM} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_WORK_GROUP} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_DEVICE} \| +
{CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_ALL_DEVICES}

|====

OpenCL C compilers supporting atomics orders or scopes beyond the mandated
minimum will define some or all of following feature macros as appropriate:

[none]
* `+__opencl_c_atomic_order_acq_rel+` -- Indicating atomic operations support acquire-release orderings.
* `+__opencl_c_atomic_order_seq_cst+` -- Indicating atomic operations and fences support acquire sequentially consistent orderings.
* `+__opencl_c_atomic_scope_device+` -- Indicating atomic operations and fences support device-wide memory ordering constraints.
* `+__opencl_c_atomic_scope_all_devices+` -- Indicating atomic operations and fences support all-device memory ordering constraints, across any host threads and all devices that can share SVM memory with each other and the host process.

== Device-Side Enqueue

Device-side enqueue and on-device queues are optional for devices supporting OpenCL 3.0.
When device-side enqueue is not supported:

OpenCL C compilers that define the feature macro `+__opencl_c_device_enqueue+` must also define the feature macro `+__opencl_c_generic_address_space+` because some OpenCL C functions for device-side enqueue accept pointers to the generic address space.
OpenCL C compilers that define the feature macro `+__opencl_c_device_enqueue+` must also define the feature macro `+__opencl_c_program_scope_global_variables+` because an implementation of blocks may interact with program scope variables in global address space as part of ABI.

|====

// Note, there are no language or SPIR-V changes for non-uniform work-groups.
// The `get_enqueued_local_size` and `get_enqueued_num_sub_groups` built-in
// functions, and the *EnqueuedWorkgroupSize* and *NumEnqueuedSubGroups*
// *BuiltIn* decorations will be supported even if the device does not support
// non-uniform Work Groups.

== Read-Write Images

Read-write images, that may be read from and written to in the same kernel, are optional for devices supporting OpenCL 3.0.

== Language Features that Were Already Optional
