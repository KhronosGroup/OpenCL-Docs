=== Description

This extension provides access to raw device pointers for cl_mem buffers
without requiring a shared virtual address space between the host and
the device.

==== Background

Shared Virtual Memory (SVM) introduced in OpenCL 2.0 is the first feature
that enables raw pointers in the OpenCL standard. Its coarse-grain
variant is relatively simple to implement on various platforms in terms of
coherency requirements, but it requires mapping the buffer's address range
to the host virtual address space.
However, various higher-level heterogeneous APIs present a memory allocation
routine which can allocate device-only memory and provide raw addresses to
it without guarentees of system-wide uniqueness. For example, minimal
implementations of OpenMP's omp_target_alloc() and CUDA/HIP's
cudaMalloc()/hipMalloc() do not require a shared address space between the host and the device.

Host-device unified addressing might not be a major implementation issue in
systems which can provide virtual memory across the platform, but might
bring challenges in cases where the device presents a global memory with
a disjoint address space (that can also be a physical memory address space) or,
for example, when a barebone embedded system lacks virtual memory support altogether.
This extension is targeted to complement the OpenCL SVM extension by providing
an additional lower-end step in the spectrum of type of pointers/buffers OpenCL
can allocate.

=== New Enums

  * {cl_mem_properties_TYPE}
  ** {CL_MEM_DEVICE_PRIVATE_ADDRESS_EXT}

=== Version History

  * Revision 1.0.0, 2025-01-15
  ** Initial version for detailed review.
  * Revision 1.0.1, 2025-01-28
  ** Made it explicit that passing illegal pointers is legal as long as they are
     not referenced. Removed CL_INVALID_ARG_VALUE as a possible error in
     clSetKernelArgDevicePointerEXT() as there are no illegal pointer
     cases when calling this function. Return CL_INVALID_OPERATION for
     clGetMemObjectInfo() if the pointer is not a buffer device pointer.
     clSetKernelExecInfo() and clSetKernelArgDevicePointerEXT() now only
     error out if no devices in the context associated with kernel support
     device pointers.
  * Revision 1.0.2, 2025-02-04
  ** Converted the clSetKernelArgDevicePointerEXT() address parameter to
     a value instead of a pointer to the value.
