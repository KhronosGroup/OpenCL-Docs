=== Description

This extension enables all types of images to be created from an existing buffer
object.

=== New Enums

  * {cl_image_requirements_info_ext_TYPE}
  ** {CL_IMAGE_REQUIREMENTS_SLICE_PITCH_ALIGNMENT_EXT}

=== Conformance tests

. Test access from kernel
  - For all image types
  - For a few/all image formats
  - For several values of row/slice pitch
  - With or without a host_ptr
    - Create buffer and fill with data
    - Optionally create a sub-buffer with a randomly selected offset?
    - Create an image from the buffer
    - Read the image from a kernel and compare with values read using the buffer and direct addressing. They must match.

//. TODO Test access via read/write/map commands?

//. TODO Test copy to/from buffer?

//. TODO Test fill?

//. TODO Test copy to/from another image?

. Test {clGetImageInfo}
  - For all image types (one format per element size)
  - For a few different row/pitch sizes (image dimensions being equal or not)
    - Create an image from a buffer
    - Check that the returned values for {CL_IMAGE_ROW_PITCH} and {CL_IMAGE_SLICE_PITCH} are correct.

. Test {clGetMemObjectInfo}
  - For all image types (1 format only)
    - Create an image from a buffer
    - Check that {CL_MEM_ASSOCIATED_MEMOBJECT} correctly returns the buffer that was used.

. Negative testing for {clCreateImage} (alignment)
  - For a few/all image formats
        - For all image types
            - Query row pitch, slice pitch and base image address alignment for the format
            - Create an image from a buffer with invalid row pitch (not a multiple of required alignment) and check that {CL_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT_DESCRIPTOR} is returned.
            - Create an image from a buffer with invalid slice pitch (not a multiple of required alignment) and check that {CL_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT_DESCRIPTOR} is returned.
            - Create an image from a buffer with invalid base address alignment (not a multiple of required alignment) and check that {CL_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT_DESCRIPTOR} is returned.

. Negative testing for {clCreateImage} (buffer size)
  - For a few image formats (at least smallest and biggest element types)
    - For all image types
      - Create a buffer too small
      - Check that image creation from that buffer is rejected with {CL_INVALID_IMAGE_SIZE}
