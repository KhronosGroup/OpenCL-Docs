=== Description

{cl_khr_global_int32_extended_atomics_EXT} allows OpenCL C extended atomic
operations to be performed on 32-bit signed and unsigned integers in global
memory.

This extension became a core feature in OpenCL 1.1, with the built-in atomic
function names changed to use the **atomic_** prefix instead of **atom_**.

See the link:{OpenCLCSpecURL}#cl_khr_global_int32_extended_atomics[Global
32-Bit Extended Atomics] section of the OpenCL C specification for more
