=== Description

{cl_khr_srgb_image_writes_EXT} enables OpenCL C kernels to write to sRGB images
using the *write_imagef* built-in function.
The sRGB image formats that may be written to will be returned by
{clGetSupportedImageFormats}.

When the image is an sRGB image, the *write_imagef* built-in function will
perform the linear to sRGB conversion.
Only the R, G, and B components are converted from linear to sRGB; the A
component is written as-is.

See the link:{OpenCLCSpecURL}#cl_khr_srgb_image_writes[sRGB Image Write
Functions] section of the OpenCL C specification for more information.
