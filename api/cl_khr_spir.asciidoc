=== Description

`cl_khr_spir` adds the ability to create an OpenCL program object from a
Standard Portable Intermediate Representation (SPIR) instance.
A SPIR instance is a vendor-neutral non-source representation for OpenCL C
programs.

`cl_khr_spir` has been superseded by the SPIR-V intermediate representation,
which is supported by the `<<cl_khr_il_program>>` extension, and is a core
feature in OpenCL 2.1.
