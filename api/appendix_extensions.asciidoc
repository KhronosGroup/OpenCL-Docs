= OpenCL Extensions (Informative)

Extensions to the OpenCL API can be defined by authors, groups of authors,
and the Khronos OpenCL Working Group.
The online Registry of extensions is available at URL

https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL

It is possible to generate versions of the API Specification incorporating
different extensions.
At present only a subset of defined extensions can be incorporated in this
fashion.

The remainder of this appendix documents a set of extensions chosen when
this document was built.

Extensions are grouped as Khronos `khr`, multivendor `ext`, and then
alphabetically by author ID.
Within each group, extensions are listed in alphabetical order by their
names.

== Experimental Extensions

_Experimental_ OpenCL extensions described in this appendix are being made
publicly available to enable review and feedback
from the community. While an extension is experimental, features may be
added, removed, or changed in non-backward compatible ways.

[NOTE]
====
Previous revisions of this specification used the term _provisional_ to denote
ratified extensions with an experimental status.
====

If you have feedback on an experimental extension, please create an issue on
the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Docs/[OpenCL-Docs
repository].

== Extension Dependencies

Extensions which have dependencies on specific core versions or on other
extensions will list such dependencies.

All extensions implicitly require support for OpenCL 1.0.
