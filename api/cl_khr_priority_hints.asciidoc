=== Description

The `cl_khr_priority_hints` extension adds priority hints for OpenCL, but
does not specify the scheduling behavior or minimum guarantees.
It is expected that the the user guides associated with each implementation
which supports this extension will describe the scheduling behavior
guarantees.

Note that the priority hint is orthogonal to functionality defined in the
`<<cl_khr_throttle_hints>>` extension.
For example, a task may have high priority ({CL_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH_KHR})
but should at the same time be executed at an optimized throttle setting
({CL_QUEUE_THROTTLE_LOW_KHR}).
