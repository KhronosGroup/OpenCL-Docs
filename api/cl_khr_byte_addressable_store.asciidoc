=== Description

`cl_khr_byte_addressable_store` relaxes restrictions on pointers to `char`,
`uchar`, `char2`, `uchar2`, `short`, `ushort` and `half` that were present
in _Section 6.8m: Restrictions_ of the OpenCL 1.0 specification.
With this extension, applications are able to read from and write to
pointers to these types.

This extension became a core feature in OpenCL 1.1.

See the link:{OpenCLCSpecURL}#cl_khr_byte_addressable_store[Byte-Addressable
