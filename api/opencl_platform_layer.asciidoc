= The OpenCL Platform Layer

This section describes the OpenCL platform layer which implements
platform-specific features that allow applications to query OpenCL devices,
device configuration information, and to create OpenCL contexts using one or
more devices.


== Querying Platform Info

[open,refpage='clGetPlatformIDs',desc='Query list of available platforms',type='protos']
--
The list of platforms available can be obtained with the function:

include::{generated}/api/protos/clGetPlatformIDs.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clGetPlatformIDs.asciidoc[]

  * _num_entries_ is the number of cl_platform_id entries that can be added to
    _platforms_.
    If _platforms_ is not `NULL`, the _num_entries_ must be greater than zero.
  * _platforms_ returns a list of OpenCL platforms found.
    The cl_platform_id values returned in _platforms_ can be used to identify a
    specific OpenCL platform.
    If _platforms_ is `NULL`, this argument is ignored.
    The number of OpenCL platforms returned is the minimum of the value
    specified by _num_entries_ or the number of OpenCL platforms available.
  * _num_platforms_ returns the number of OpenCL platforms available.
    If _num_platforms_ is `NULL`, this argument is ignored.

// refError

{clGetPlatformIDs} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _num_entries_ is equal to zero and _platforms_ is
    not `NULL` or if both _num_platforms_ and _platforms_ are `NULL`.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
--

[open,refpage='clGetPlatformInfo',desc='Query information about an OpenCL platform',type='protos']
--
Specific information about an OpenCL platform can be obtained with
the function:

include::{generated}/api/protos/clGetPlatformInfo.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clGetPlatformInfo.asciidoc[]

  * _platform_ refers to the platform ID returned by {clGetPlatformIDs} or can
    be `NULL`.
    If _platform_ is `NULL`, the behavior is implementation-defined.
  * _param_name_ is an enumeration constant that identifies the platform
    information being queried.
    It can be one of the following values as specified in the
    <<platform-queries-table, Platform Queries>> table.
  * _param_value_ is a pointer to memory location where appropriate values for a
    given _param_name_, as specified in the <<platform-queries-table, Platform
    Queries>> table, will be returned.
    If _param_value_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.
  * _param_value_size_ specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to by
    _param_value_.
    This size in bytes must be {geq} size of return type specified in the
    <<platform-queries-table, Platform Queries>> table.
  * _param_value_size_ret_ returns the actual size in bytes of data being
    queried by _param_name_.
    If _param_value_size_ret_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.

The information that can be queried using {clGetPlatformInfo} is specified
in the <<platform-queries-table, Platform Queries>> table.

        In each returned description structure, the name field is required to be
        "OpenCL C". The list may include both newer non-backwards compatible
        OpenCL C versions, such as OpenCL C 3.0, and older OpenCL C versions
        with mandatory backwards compatibility.
        The version returned by {CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION} is required to be
        present in the list.

        For devices that support compilation from OpenCL C source:

        Because OpenCL 3.0 is backwards compatible with OpenCL C 1.2,
        and OpenCL C 1.2 is backwards compatible with OpenCL C 1.1 and
        OpenCL C 1.0, support for at least OpenCL C 3.0, OpenCL C 1.2,
        OpenCL C 1.1, and OpenCL C 1.0 is required for an OpenCL 3.0 device.

        Support for OpenCL C 2.0, OpenCL C 1.2, OpenCL C 1.1, and OpenCL C
        1.0 is required for an OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, or OpenCL 2.2 device.

        Support for OpenCL C 1.2, OpenCL C 1.1, and OpenCL C 1.0 is required
        for an OpenCL 1.2 device.

        Support for OpenCL C 1.1 and OpenCL C 1.0 is required for an
        OpenCL 1.1 device.

        Support for at least OpenCL C 1.0 is required for an OpenCL 1.0 device.

        For devices that do not support compilation from OpenCL C source,
        this query may return an empty array.

        Additionally, the following Khronos extension names must be returned
        by all devices that support OpenCL 1.2:

        *cl_khr_fp64* (if double precision is supported)

        Additionally, the following Khronos extension names must be returned
        by all devices that support OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, or OpenCL 2.2.
        Note that these Khronos extension names are *not* required for

    OpenCL adopters must report a valid vendor ID for their implementation.
    If there is no valid PCI vendor ID defined for the physical device,
    implementations must obtain a Khronos vendor ID. This is a unique
    identifier greater than the largest PCI vendor ID(0x10000) and is
    representable by a `cl_uint`. Khronos vendor IDs are synchronized across
    APIs by utilizing Vulkan's vk.xml as the central Khronos vendor ID registry.
    An ID must be reserved here prior to use in OpenCL, regardless of whether a
    vendor implements Vulkan. Only once the ID has been allotted may it be
    exposed to OpenCL by proposing a merge request against cl.xml, in the master
    branch of the OpenCL-Docs project. The merge must define a new enumerant by
    adding an `<enum>` tag to the `cl_khronos_vendor_id` `<enums>` tag, with the
    `<value>` attribute set as the acquired Khronos vendor ID. The `<name>`
    attribute must identify the vendor/adopter, and be of the form
    `CL_KHRONOS_VENDOR_ID_<vendor>`.

5::
    A kernel that uses an image argument with the write_only or read_write
    image qualifier may result in additional read_only images resources being
    created internally by an implementation.
    The internally created read_only image resources will count against the max
    supported read image arguments given by {CL_DEVICE_MAX_READ_IMAGE_ARGS}.
    Enqueuing a kernel that requires more images than the implementation can
    support will result in a {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} error being returned.

6::
    NOTE: {CL_DEVICE_MAX_WRITE_IMAGE_ARGS} is only there for backward
    compatibility.
    {CL_DEVICE_MAX_READ_WRITE_IMAGE_ARGS} should be used instead.

    The optional rounding modes should be included as a device capability

    The platform profile returns the profile that is implemented by the
    OpenCL framework.
    If the platform profile returned is FULL_PROFILE, the OpenCL framework
    will support devices that are FULL_PROFILE and may also support devices
    that are EMBEDDED_PROFILE.
    The compiler must be available for all devices i.e.
    {CL_DEVICE_COMPILER_AVAILABLE} is {CL_TRUE}.
    If the platform profile returned is EMBEDDED_PROFILE, then devices that
    are only EMBEDDED_PROFILE are supported.

    query.
  * _host_timestamp_ will be updated with the value of the host timer in

    _device_timer_ was returned.
    The resolution of the timer may be queried via {clGetPlatformInfo} and the

The host timestamp and device timestamp returned by this function and
{clGetHostTimer} each have an implementation defined timebase.
The timestamps will always be in their respective timebases regardless of
which query function is used.

This value is in the same timebase as the _host_timestamp_ returned from
{clGetDeviceAndHostTimer}.
The implementation will return with as low a latency as possible to allow a
correlation with a subsequent application sampled time.
The host timestamp and device timestamp returned by this function and
{clGetDeviceAndHostTimer} each have an implementation defined timebase.
The timestamps will always be in their respective timebases regardless of
which query function is used.
The timestamp returned from {clGetEventProfilingInfo} for an event on a
device and a device timestamp queried from the same device will always be in
the same timebase.

{clGetHostTimer} will return {CL_SUCCESS} with a time value in
_host_timestamp_ if provided.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_DEVICE} if _device_ is not a valid device.
  * {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if the platform associated with _device_ does not support Device and Host Timer Synchronization.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _host_timestamp_ is `NULL`.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

To create sub-devices partitioning an OpenCL device, call the function:

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCreateSubDevices.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clCreateSubDevices.asciidoc[]

  * _in_device_ is the device to be partitioned.
  * _properties_ specifies how _in_device_ is to be partitioned, described by a
    partition name and its corresponding value.
    Each partition name is immediately followed by the corresponding desired
    value.
    The list is terminated with 0.
    The list of supported partitioning schemes is described in the
    <<subdevice-partition-table, Subdevice Partition>> table.
    Only one of the listed partitioning schemes can be specified in
    _properties_.
  * _num_devices_ is the size of memory pointed to by _out_devices_ specified as
    the number of cl_device_id entries.
  * _out_devices_ is the buffer where the OpenCL sub-devices will be returned.
    If _out_devices_ is `NULL`, this argument is ignored.
    If _out_devices_ is not `NULL`, _num_devices_ must be greater than or equal
    to the number of sub-devices that _device_ may be partitioned into according
    to the partitioning scheme specified in _properties_.
  * _num_devices_ret_ returns the number of sub-devices that _device_ may be
    partitioned into according to the partitioning scheme specified in
    _properties_.
    If _num_devices_ret_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.

{clCreateSubDevices} creates an array of sub-devices that each reference a
non-intersecting set of compute units within _in_device_, according to the
partition scheme given by _properties_.
The output sub-devices may be used in every way that the root (or parent)
device can be used, including creating contexts, building programs, further
calls to {clCreateSubDevices} and creating command-queues.
When a command-queue is created against a sub-device, the commands enqueued
on the queue are executed only on the sub-device.

// refError

{clCreateSubDevices} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the partition is created
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns a `NULL` value with the following error values
returned in _errcode_ret_:

  * {CL_INVALID_DEVICE} if _in_device_ is not a valid device.

A few examples that describe how to specify partition properties in
_properties_ argument to {clCreateSubDevices} are given below:

To partition a device containing 16 compute units into two sub-devices, each
containing 8 compute units, pass the following in _properties_:

[source,c]
----
{ CL_DEVICE_PARTITION_EQUALLY, 8, 0 }
----

To partition a device with four compute units into two sub-devices with one
sub-device containing 3 compute units and the other sub-device 1 compute
unit, pass the following in properties argument:

[source,c]
----
{ CL_DEVICE_PARTITION_BY_COUNTS,
  3, 1, CL_DEVICE_PARTITION_BY_COUNTS_LIST_END, 0 }
----

To split a device along the outermost cache line (if any), pass the
following in properties argument:

To retain a device, call the function:

include::{generated}/api/protos/clRetainDevice.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clRetainDevice.asciidoc[]

  * _device_ is the OpenCL device to retain.

{clRetainDevice} increments the _device_ reference count if _device_ is a
valid sub-device created by a call to {clCreateSubDevices}.
If _device_ is a root level device i.e. a cl_device_id returned by
{clGetDeviceIDs}, the _device_ reference count remains unchanged.

// refError

{clRetainDevice} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed successfully
or the device is a root-level device.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_DEVICE} if _device_ is not a valid device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

[open,refpage='clReleaseDevice',desc='Release an OpenCL device',type='protos',xrefs='clRetainDevice']
--
To release a device, call the function:

include::{generated}/api/protos/clReleaseDevice.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clReleaseDevice.asciidoc[]

  * _device_ is the OpenCL device to retain.

{clReleaseDevice} decrements the _device_ reference count if device is a
valid sub-device created by a call to {clCreateSubDevices}.
If _device_ is a root level device i.e. a cl_device_id returned by
{clGetDeviceIDs}, the _device_ reference count remains unchanged.

// refError

{clReleaseDevice} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_DEVICE} if _device_ is not a valid device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

After the _device_ reference count becomes zero and all the objects attached
to _device_ (such as command-queues) are released, the _device_ object is
deleted.
Using this function to release a reference that was not obtained by creating
the object or by calling {clRetainDevice} causes undefined behavior.

== Contexts

[open,refpage='clCreateContext',desc='Create an OpenCL context',type='protos']
--
To create an OpenCL context, call the function:

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCreateContext.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clCreateContext.asciidoc[]

  * _properties_ specifies a list of context property names and their
    corresponding values.
    Each property name is immediately followed by the corresponding desired
    value.
    The list is terminated with 0.
    The list of supported properties is described in the
    <<context-properties-table, Context Properties>> table.
    _properties_ can be `NULL` in which case the platform that is selected is
    implementation-defined.
  * _num_devices_ is the number of devices specified in the _devices_ argument.
  * _devices_ is a pointer to a list of unique devices^9^ returned by
    {clGetDeviceIDs} or sub-devices created by {clCreateSubDevices} for a
    platform.
+
9::
    Duplicate devices specified in _devices_ are ignored.
  * _pfn_notify_ is a callback function that can be registered by the
    application.
    This callback function will be used by the OpenCL implementation to report
    information on errors during context creation as well as errors that occur
    at runtime in this context.
    This callback function may be called asynchronously by the OpenCL
    implementation.
    It is the applications responsibility to ensure that the callback function
    is thread-safe.
    If _pfn_notify_ is `NULL`, no callback function is registered.
  * _user_data_ will be passed as the _user_data_ argument when _pfn_notify_ is
    called.
    _user_data_ can be `NULL`.
  * _errcode_ret_ will return an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

The parameters to the callback function _pfn_notify_ are:

  * _errinfo_ is a pointer to an error string.
  * _private_info_ and _cb_ represent a pointer to binary data that is
    returned by the OpenCL implementation that can be used to log additional
    information helpful in debugging the error.
  * _user_data_ is a pointer to user supplied data.

Contexts are used by the OpenCL runtime for managing objects such as
command-queues, memory, program and kernel objects and for executing kernels
on one or more devices specified in the context.

  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _num_devices_ is equal to zero.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _pfn_notify_ is `NULL` but _user_data_ is not
    `NULL`.
  * {CL_INVALID_DEVICE} if any device in _devices_ is not a valid device.
  * {CL_DEVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE} if a device in _devices_ is currently not
    available even though the device was returned by {clGetDeviceIDs}.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required

[NOTE]
====
It is possible that a device(s) becomes unavailable after a context and
command-queues that use this device(s) have been created and commands have
been queued to command-queues.
In this case the behavior of OpenCL API calls that use this context (and
command-queues) are considered to be implementation-defined.
The user callback function, if specified, when the context is created can be
used to record appropriate information in the _errinfo_, _private_info_
arguments passed to the callback function when the device becomes
unavailable.

  * _context_ specifies the OpenCL context to retain.

{clRetainContext} increments the _context_ reference count.

{clCreateContext} and {clCreateContextFromType} perform an implicit retain.
This is very helpful for 3^rd^ party libraries, which typically get a
context passed to them by the application.
However, it is possible that the application may delete the context without
