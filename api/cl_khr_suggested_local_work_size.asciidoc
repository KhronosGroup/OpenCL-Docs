=== Description

`cl_khr_suggested_local_work_size` adds the ability to query a suggested
local work-group size for a kernel running on a device for a specified
global work size and global work offset.
The suggested local work-group size will match the work-group size that
would be chosen if the kernel were enqueued with the specified global work
size and global work offset and a `NULL` local work size.

By using the suggested local work-group size query an application has
greater insight into the local work-group size chosen by the OpenCL
implementation, and the OpenCL implementation need not re-compute the local
work-group size if the same kernel is enqueued multiple times with the same
parameters.
