In this section we describe the API calls that manage OpenCL objects such as
command-queues, memory objects, program objects, kernel objects for kernel
functions in a program and calls that allow you to enqueue commands to a
command-queue such as executing a kernel, reading, or writing a memory
object.

== Command-Queues

OpenCL objects such as memory, program and kernel objects are created using
a context.
Operations on these objects are performed using a command-queue.
The command-queue can be used to queue a set of operations (referred to as
commands) in order.
Having multiple command-queues allows applications to queue multiple
independent commands without requiring synchronization.
Note that this should work as long as these objects are not being shared.
Sharing of objects across multiple command-queues will require the
application to perform appropriate synchronization.
This is described in <<shared-opencl-objects, Shared OpenCL Objects>>

  * _context_ must be a valid OpenCL context.
  * _device_ must be a device or sub-device associated with _context_.
    It can either be in the list of devices and sub-devices specified when
    _context_ is created using {clCreateContext} or be a root device with
    the same device type as specified when _context_ is created using
    {clCreateContextFromType}.
  * _properties_ specifies a list of properties for the command-queue and their
    corresponding values.
    Each property name is immediately followed by the corresponding desired
    value.
    The list is terminated with 0.
    The list of supported properties is described in the
    <<queue-properties-table, table below>>.
    If a supported property and its value is not specified in _properties_, its
    default value will be used.
    _properties_ can be `NULL` in which case the default values for supported
    command-queue properties will be used.
  * _errcode_ret_ will return an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

== Buffer Objects

A _buffer_ object stores a one-dimensional collection of elements.
Elements of a _buffer_ object can be a scalar data type (such as an int,
float), vector data type, or a user-defined structure.


===  Creating Buffer Objects

[open,refpage='clCreateBuffer',desc='Creates a buffer object.',type='protos',alias='clCreateBufferWithProperties']
--
A *buffer object* may be created using the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCreateBuffer.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clCreateBuffer.asciidoc[]

A *buffer object* may also be created with additional properties using the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCreateBufferWithProperties.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clCreateBufferWithProperties.asciidoc[]

  * _context_ is a valid OpenCL context used to create the buffer object.
  * _properties_ is an optional list of properties for the buffer object and their corresponding values.
    The list is terminated with the special property `0`.
    If no properties are required, _properties_ may be `NULL`.
    OpenCL 3.0 does not define any optional properties for buffers,
    but extensions may define properties as described in the
    <<external-buffer-memory-properties-table>>.
  * _flags_ is a bit-field that is used to specify allocation and usage
    information about the image memory object being created and is described in
    the <<memory-flags-table, supported memory flag values>> table.
  * _size_ is the size in bytes of the buffer memory object to be allocated.
  * _host_ptr_ is a pointer to the buffer data that may already be allocated
    by the application.
    The size of the buffer that _host_ptr_ points to must be greater than or equal to _size_
    bytes.
  * _errcode_ret_ may return an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

The alignment requirements for data stored in buffer objects are described
in <<alignment-app-data-types,Alignment of Application Data Types>>.

If {clCreateBuffer} or {clCreateBufferWithProperties} is called with
{CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR} set in its _flags_ argument, the contents of the
memory pointed to by _host_ptr_ at the time of the {clCreateBuffer} call
define the initial contents of the buffer object.

If {clCreateBuffer} or {clCreateBufferWithProperties} is called with a
pointer returned by {clSVMAlloc} as its _host_ptr_ argument, and
{CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR} is set in its _flags_ argument, {clCreateBuffer} or
{clCreateBufferWithProperties} will succeed and return a valid non-zero
buffer object as long as the _size_ argument is no larger than the
_size_ argument passed in the original {clSVMAlloc} call.
The new buffer object returned has the shared memory as the underlying
storage.
Locations in the buffers underlying shared memory can be operated on using
atomic operations to the devices level of support as defined in the memory
model.

      device-side address for its lifetime, and the address can be queried via {clGetMemObjectInfo}.

   Each device in the context can have their own (fixed) device-side address and
   a copy of the created buffer which are synchronized
   implicitly by the runtime.

   The flag might imply that the buffer will be "pinned" permanently to
   a device's memory, but might not be necessarily so, as long as the address
   range of the buffer remains constant.

   The device addresses of sub-buffers derived from {CL_MEM_DEVICE_PRIVATE_ADDRESS_EXT}
   allocated buffers can be computed by adding the sub-buffer origin to the
   device-specific start address.

   If the device supports SVM and {clCreateBufferWithProperties} is called with a pointer
   returned by {clSVMAlloc} as its _host_ptr_ argument, and {CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR} is
   set in its _flags_ argument, the device-side address is guaranteed to match
   the _host_ptr_.

| Memory Flags | Description
| {CL_MEM_READ_WRITE_anchor}

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/CL_MEM_READ_WRITE.asciidoc[]
  | This flag specifies that the memory object will be read
    and written by a kernel.
    This is the default.
| {CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY_anchor}

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY.asciidoc[]
  | This flag specifies that the memory object will be
    written but not read by a kernel.

    Reading from a buffer or image object created with {CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY}
    inside a kernel is undefined.

    {CL_MEM_READ_WRITE} and {CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY} are mutually exclusive.
| {CL_MEM_READ_ONLY_anchor}

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/CL_MEM_READ_ONLY.asciidoc[]
  | This flag specifies that the memory object is a
    readonly memory object when used inside a kernel.

    Writing to a buffer or image object created with {CL_MEM_READ_ONLY} inside
    a kernel is undefined.

    {CL_MEM_READ_WRITE} or {CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY} and {CL_MEM_READ_ONLY} are mutually
    exclusive.
| {CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR_anchor}

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR.asciidoc[]
  | This flag is valid only if host_ptr is not `NULL`.
    If specified, it indicates that the application wants the OpenCL
    implementation to use memory referenced by host_ptr as the storage bits
    for the memory object.

    The contents of the memory pointed to by host_ptr at the time of the
    {clCreateBuffer}, {clCreateBufferWithProperties}, {clCreateImage},
    {clCreateImageWithProperties}, {clCreateImage2D}, or {clCreateImage3D}
    call define the initial contents of the memory object.

    OpenCL implementations are allowed to cache the contents pointed
    to by host_ptr in device memory.
    This cached copy can be used when kernels are executed on a device.

    The result of OpenCL commands that operate on multiple buffer objects
    created with the same host_ptr or from overlapping host or SVM regions
    is considered to be undefined.
| {CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR_anchor}

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR.asciidoc[]
  | This flag is valid only if host_ptr is not `NULL`.
    If specified, it indicates that the application wants the OpenCL
    implementation to allocate memory for the memory object and copy the
    data from memory referenced by host_ptr.
    The implementation will copy the memory immediately and host_ptr is
    available for reuse by the application when the {clCreateBuffer},
    {clCreateBufferWithProperties}, {clCreateImage}, {clCreateImageWithProperties},
    {clCreateImage2D}, or {clCreateImage3D} operation returns.

    {CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR} and {CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR} are mutually exclusive.

    {CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR} can be used with {CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR} to

    host-accessible (e.g. PCIe) memory.
| {CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY_anchor}

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY.asciidoc[]
  | This flag specifies that the host will only write to the memory object
    (using OpenCL APIs that enqueue a write or a map for write).
    This can be used to optimize write access from the host (e.g. enable
    write-combined allocations for memory objects for devices that
    communicate with the host over a system bus such as PCIe).

include::{generated}/api/protos/clEnqueueWriteBuffer.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clEnqueueWriteBuffer.asciidoc[]

  * _command_queue_ is a valid host command-queue in which the read / write
    command will be queued.
    _command_queue_ and _buffer_ must be created with the same OpenCL context.
  * _buffer_ refers to a valid buffer object.
  * _blocking_read_ and _blocking_write_ indicate if the read and write
    operations are _blocking_ or _non-blocking_ (see below).
  * _offset_ is the offset in bytes in the buffer object to read from or write
    to.
  * _size_ is the size in bytes of data being read or written.
  * _ptr_ is the pointer to buffer in host memory where data is to be read into
    or to be written from.
  * _event_wait_list_ and _num_events_in_wait_list_ specify events that need to
    complete before this particular command can be executed.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then this particular command does not wait
    on any event to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
    If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0.
    The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as synchronization points.
    The context associated with events in _event_wait_list_ and _command_queue_
    must be the same.
    The memory associated with _event_wait_list_ can be reused or freed after
    the function returns.
  * _event_ returns an event object that identifies this read / write command
    and can be used to query or queue a wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_ is `NULL` or the enqueue is unsuccessful, no event will be
    created and therefore it will not be possible to query the status of this
    command or to wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ and _event_ are not `NULL`, _event_ must not refer
    to an element of the _event_wait_list_ array.

If _blocking_read_ is {CL_TRUE} i.e. the read command is blocking,
{clEnqueueReadBuffer} does not return until the buffer data has been read
and copied into memory pointed to by _ptr_.

If _blocking_read_ is {CL_FALSE} i.e. the read command is non-blocking,
{clEnqueueReadBuffer} queues a non-blocking read command and returns.
The contents of the buffer that _ptr_ points to cannot be used until the
read command has completed.
The _event_ argument returns an event object which can be used to query the
execution status of the read command.
When the read command has completed, the contents of the buffer that _ptr_
points to can be used by the application.

If _blocking_write_ is {CL_TRUE}, the write command is blocking and does not
return until the command is complete, including transfer of the data.
The memory pointed to by _ptr_ can be reused by the application after the
{clEnqueueWriteBuffer} call returns.

If _blocking_write_ is {CL_FALSE}, the OpenCL implementation will use _ptr_ to
perform a non-blocking write.
As the write is non-blocking the implementation can return immediately.
The memory pointed to by _ptr_ cannot be reused by the application after the
call returns.
The _event_ argument returns an event object which can be used to query the
execution status of the write command.
When the write command has completed, the memory pointed to by _ptr_ can
then be reused by the application.

    For a 2D rectangle copy, the _depth_ value given by _region_[2] should be 1.
    The values in region cannot be 0.
  * _buffer_row_pitch_ is the length of each row in bytes to be used for the
    memory region associated with _buffer_.
    If _buffer_row_pitch_ is 0, _buffer_row_pitch_ is computed as _region_[0].
  * _buffer_slice_pitch_ is the length of each 2D slice in bytes to be used for
    the memory region associated with _buffer_.
    If _buffer_slice_pitch_ is 0, _buffer_slice_pitch_ is computed as
    _region_[1] {times} _buffer_row_pitch_.
  * _host_row_pitch_ is the length of each row in bytes to be used for the
    memory region pointed to by _ptr_.
    If _host_row_pitch_ is 0, _host_row_pitch_ is computed as _region_[0].
  * _host_slice_pitch_ is the length of each 2D slice in bytes to be used for
    the memory region pointed to by _ptr_.
    If _host_slice_pitch_ is 0, _host_slice_pitch_ is computed as _region_[1]
    {times} _host_row_pitch_.
  * _ptr_ is the pointer to buffer in host memory where data is to be read into
    or to be written from.
  * _event_wait_list_ and _num_events_in_wait_list_ specify events that need to
    complete before this particular command can be executed.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then this particular command does not wait
    on any event to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
    If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0.
    The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as synchronization points.
    The context associated with events in _event_wait_list_ and _command_queue_
    must be the same.
    The memory associated with _event_wait_list_ can be reused or freed after
    the function returns.
  * _event_ returns an event object that identifies this read / write command
    and can be used to query or queue a wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_ is `NULL` or the enqueue is unsuccessful, no event will be
    created and therefore it will not be possible to query the status of this
    command or to wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ and _event_ are not `NULL`, _event_ must not refer
    to an element of the _event_wait_list_ array.


If _blocking_read_ is {CL_TRUE} i.e. the read command is blocking,
{clEnqueueReadBufferRect} does not return until the buffer data has been
read and copied into memory pointed to by _ptr_.

If _blocking_read_ is {CL_FALSE} i.e. the read command is non-blocking,
{clEnqueueReadBufferRect} queues a non-blocking read command and returns.
The contents of the buffer that _ptr_ points to cannot be used until the
read command has completed.
The _event_ argument returns an event object which can be used to query the
execution status of the read command.
When the read command has completed, the contents of the buffer that _ptr_
points to can be used by the application.

If _blocking_write_ is {CL_TRUE}, the write command is blocking and does not
return until the command is complete, including transfer of the data.
The memory pointed to by _ptr_ can be reused by the application after the
{clEnqueueWriteBufferRect} call returns.

If _blocking_write_ is {CL_FALSE}, the OpenCL implementation will use _ptr_ to
perform a non-blocking write.
As the write is non-blocking the implementation can return immediately.
The memory pointed to by _ptr_ cannot be reused by the application after the
call returns.
The _event_ argument returns an event object which can be used to query the
execution status of the write command.
When the write command has completed, the memory pointed to by _ptr_ can
then be reused by the application.

    The data pattern must be a scalar or vector integer or floating-point data
    type supported by OpenCL as described in <<scalar-data-types, Shared
    Application Scalar Data Types>> and <<vector-data-types, Supported
    Application Vector Data Types>>.

To enqueue a command to map a region of the buffer object given by _buffer_
into the host address space and returns a pointer to this mapped region,
call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clEnqueueMapBuffer.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clEnqueueMapBuffer.asciidoc[]

  * _command_queue_ must be a valid host command-queue.
  * _blocking_map_ indicates if the map operation is _blocking_ or
    _non-blocking_.

If _blocking_map_ is {CL_TRUE}, {clEnqueueMapBuffer} does not return until the
specified region in _buffer_ is mapped into the host address space and the
application can access the contents of the mapped region using the pointer
returned by {clEnqueueMapBuffer}.

If _blocking_map_ is {CL_FALSE} i.e. map operation is non-blocking, the
pointer to the mapped region returned by {clEnqueueMapBuffer} cannot be used
until the map command has completed.
The _event_ argument returns an event object which can be used to query the
execution status of the map command.
When the map command is completed, the application can access the contents
of the mapped region using the pointer returned by {clEnqueueMapBuffer}.

  * _map_flags_ is a bit-field and is described in the
    <<memory-map-flags-table,Memory Map Flags>> table.
  * _buffer_ is a valid buffer object.
    The OpenCL context associated with _command_queue_ and _buffer_ must be the
    same.
  * _offset_ and _size_ are the offset in bytes and the size of the region in
    the buffer object that is being mapped.
  * _event_wait_list_ and _num_events_in_wait_list_ specify events that need to
    complete before this particular command can be executed.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then this particular command does not wait
    on any event to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
    If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0.
    The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as synchronization points.

    command-queue.
  * {CL_INVALID_CONTEXT} if context associated with _command_queue_ and

The pointer returned maps a region starting at _offset_ and is at least
_size_ bytes in size.
The result of a memory access outside this region is undefined.

If the buffer object is created with {CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR} set in _mem_flags_,
the following will be true:

  * The _host_ptr_ specified in {clCreateBuffer} or {clCreateBufferWithProperties}
    will contain the latest bits in the region being mapped when the
    {clEnqueueMapBuffer} command has completed.
  * The pointer value returned by {clEnqueueMapBuffer} will be derived from
    the _host_ptr_ specified when the buffer object is created.

Mapped buffer objects are unmapped using {clEnqueueUnmapMemObject}.
This is described in <<unmapping-mapped-memory, Unmapping Mapped Memory
Objects>>.

== Image Objects

An _image_ object is used to store a one-, two- or three-dimensional
texture, frame-buffer or image.
The elements of an image object are selected from a list of predefined image
formats.
The minimum number of elements in a memory object is one.

  * _context_ is a valid OpenCL context used to create the image object.
  * _properties_ is an optional list of properties for the image object and their corresponding values.
    The list is terminated with the special property `0`.
    If no properties are required, _properties_ may be `NULL`.
    OpenCL 3.0 does not define any optional properties for images,
    but extensions may define properties as described in the
    <<external-image-memory-properties-table>>.
  * _flags_ is a bit-field that is used to specify allocation and usage
    information about the image memory object being created and is described in
    the <<memory-flags-table, supported memory flag values>> table.
  * _image_format_ is a pointer to a structure that describes format properties
    of the image to be allocated.
    A 1D image buffer can be created from a buffer by specifying a buffer object
    in __image_desc__->__mem_object__.
    If the {cl_khr_image2d_from_buffer_EXT} extension is supported, a 2D image
    can be created from a buffer by specifying a buffer object in
    __image_desc__->__mem_object__.

    image object in the __image_desc__->__mem_object__.
    Refer to the <<image-format-descriptor, Image Format Descriptor>> section
    for a detailed description of the image format descriptor.

    of the image to be allocated.
    Refer to the <<image-descriptor, Image Descriptor>> section for a detailed
    description of the image descriptor.

    the application.
    Refer to the <<host-ptr-buffer-size-table, table below>> for a description
    of how large the buffer that _host_ptr_ points to must be.
  * _errcode_ret_ will return an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

The alignment requirements for data stored in image objects are described
in <<alignment-app-data-types,Alignment of Application Data Types>>.

For all image types except {CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE1D_BUFFER}, if the value
specified for _flags_ is 0, the default is used which is {CL_MEM_READ_WRITE}.

another memory object (image or buffer), if the {CL_MEM_READ_WRITE},
{CL_MEM_READ_ONLY} or {CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY} values are not specified in _flags_,
they are inherited from the corresponding memory access qualifiers associated
with __mem_object__.
The {CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR}, {CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR} and {CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR}
values cannot be specified in _flags_ but are inherited from the
corresponding memory access qualifiers associated with __mem_object__.
If {CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR} is specified in the memory access qualifier values
associated with __mem_object__ it does not imply any additional copies when
the image is created from __mem_object__.
If the {CL_MEM_HOST_WRITE_ONLY}, {CL_MEM_HOST_READ_ONLY} or

*Mipmap Images*

A mipmapped 1D image, 1D image array, 2D image, 2D image array or 3D image
is created by specifying _num_mip_levels_ to be a value greater than one in
_image_desc_.
The dimensions of a mipmapped image can be a power of two or a non-power of
two.
Each successively smaller mipmap level is half the size of the previous
level, rounded down to the nearest integer.

The following restrictions apply when mipmapped images are created with
{clCreateImage}:

// TODO The actual errors returned from clCreateImage are not specified by
// the cl_khr_mipmap_image extension

  * {CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR} or {CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR} cannot be specified if a

*Tiling Control*

{CL_MEM_IMAGE_TILING_EXT_anchor} can be passed as part of the _properties_ parameter
to {clCreateImageWithProperties} to control the tiling used for the image being
created. The following values are accepted:

  * {CL_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR_EXT_anchor}, requires image data
    be laid out in so-called raster order, one row after the other, one slice or
    array layer after the other in memory according to the pitches provided by
    the application or calculated.

  * {CL_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL_EXT_anchor} requires image data be laid out in an
    implementation-defined format which can vary depending on the type of image,
    its format and/or dimensions. The implementation will attempt to select the
    best layout for the image.

If {CL_MEM_IMAGE_TILING_EXT} is passed and set to a value different from
{CL_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR_EXT} and {CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR} is set in _mem_flags_, the data
pointed to by _host_ptr_ is laid out using linear tiling and its layout is described
in the same way as for case whe {CL_MEM_IMAGE_TILING_EXT} is not set or set to
{CL_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR_EXT}.

If {CL_MEM_IMAGE_TILING_EXT} is not passed, then tiling is selected by the
implementation and applications can query the selected tiling using
the {CL_IMAGE_TILING_EXT} query.

When creating an image from a buffer, _image_row_pitch_ and _image_slice_pitch_
must both be `0` if {CL_MEM_IMAGE_TILING_EXT} is passed and set to
{CL_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL_EXT}. The data in the buffer and its underlying memory
are reused as-is and the exact behaviour is implementation-defined.

*Image Data in Host Memory*

For a 3D image or 2D image array, the image data specified by _host_ptr_ is
stored as a linear sequence of adjacent 2D image slices or 2D images
respectively.
Each 2D image is a linear sequence of adjacent scanlines.
Each scanline is a linear sequence of image elements.

For a 2D image, the image data specified by _host_ptr_ is stored as a linear
sequence of adjacent scanlines.
Each scanline is a linear sequence of image elements.

For a 1D image array, the image data specified by _host_ptr_ is stored as a
linear sequence of adjacent 1D images.
Each 1D image is stored as a single scanline which is a linear sequence of
adjacent elements.

For 1D image or 1D image buffer, the image data specified by _host_ptr_ is
stored as a single scanline which is a linear sequence of adjacent elements.

Image elements are stored according to their image format as described in the
<<image-format-descriptor, Image Format Descriptor>> section.

For example, to specify a normalized unsigned 8-bit / channel RGBA image,
`image_channel_order` = {CL_RGBA}, and `image_channel_data_type` =
{CL_UNORM_INT8}.
The memory layout of this image format is described below:

// (Jon) these tables are missing "Byte Offset -> 0 1 2 3 ..."

[width="60%",cols="<10%,<10%,<10%,<10%,<60%"]

|====

with the corresponding byte offsets

[width="60%",cols="<10%,<10%,<10%,<10%,<60%"]
|====
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ...
|====

Similar, if `image_channel_order` = {CL_RGBA} and `image_channel_data_type` =
{CL_SIGNED_INT16}, the memory layout of this image format is described below:

[width="60%",cols="<10%,<10%,<10%,<10%,<60%"]

with the corresponding byte offsets

`image_channel_data_type` values of {CL_UNORM_SHORT_565}, {CL_UNORM_SHORT_555},
{CL_UNORM_INT_101010}, and {CL_UNORM_INT_101010_2} are special cases of packed
image formats where the channels of each element are packed into a single
unsigned short or unsigned int.
For these special packed image formats, the channels are normally packed
with the first channel in the most significant bits of the bitfield, and
successive channels occupying progressively less significant locations.
For {CL_UNORM_SHORT_565}, R is in bits 15:11, G is in bits 10:5 and B is in

OpenCL implementations must maintain the minimum precision specified by the
number of bits in `image_channel_data_type`.
If the image format specified by `image_channel_order`, and
`image_channel_data_type` cannot be supported by the OpenCL implementation,
then the call to {clCreateImage}, {clCreateImageWithProperties},
{clCreateImage2D}, or {clCreateImage3D} will return a `NULL` memory object.

For a 1D image buffer created from a buffer object, the `image_width` {times}
size of element in bytes must be {leq} size of the buffer object.
The image data in the buffer object is stored as a single scanline which is
a linear sequence of adjacent elements.

ifdef::cl_ext_image_from_buffer[]
For a 1D image created from a buffer object, the `image_width` {times} size of
element in bytes must be {leq} size of the buffer object. The image data in the

adjacent elements.

For a 1D image array created from a buffer object, the `image_slice_pitch` {times}
`image_array_size` must be {leq} size of the buffer object specified by `mem_object`.
The image data in the buffer object is stored as a linear sequence of adjacent 1D
slices. Each slice is a single scanline padded to `image_slice_pitch` bytes.

For a 2D image created from a buffer object, the `image_row_pitch` {times}
`image_height` must be {leq} size of the buffer object specified by
`mem_object`.
The image data in the buffer object is stored as a linear sequence of

For a 2D image array created from a buffer object, the `image_slice_pitch` {times}
`image_array_size` must be {leq} size of the buffer object specified by `mem_object`.
The image data in the buffer object is stored as a linear sequence of adjacent 2D
slices. Each slice is a linear sequence of adjacent scanlines padded to
`image_slice_pitch` bytes. Each scanline is a linear sequence of image elements padded
to `image_row_pitch` bytes.

For a 3D image created from a buffer object, the `image_slice_pitch` {times}

endif::cl_ext_image_from_buffer[]

For an image object created from another image object, the values specified
in the image descriptor except for `mem_object` must match the image
descriptor information associated with `mem_object`.

Image elements are stored according to their image format as described in
<<image-format-descriptor, Image Format Descriptor>>.

    value for all devices in the context associated with the buffer specified by
    `mem_object` that support images, otherwise.
endif::cl_ext_image_requirements_info[]

Creating a 2D image object from another 2D image object creates a new
2D image object that shares the image data store with `mem_object` but views
the pixels in the image with a different image channel order.
Restrictions are:

  * All of the values specified in _image_desc_ must match the image descriptor
    information associated with `mem_object`, except for `mem_object`.
  * The image channel data type specified in _image_format_ must match the
    image channel data type associated with `mem_object`.
  * The image channel order specified in _image_format_ must be compatible
    with the image channel order associated with `mem_object`, as described
    in the <<compatibile-image-channel-orders-table, Compatible Image
    Channel Orders>> table.

NOTE: The image channel order compatibility constraint allows creation of a
sRGB view of the image from a linear RGB view or vice-versa, i.e. the pixels
stored in the image can be accessed as linear RGB or sRGB values.

==== Image Format Mapping to OpenCL Kernel Language Image Access Qualifiers

Image arguments to kernels may have the `read_only`, `write_only` or
`read_write` qualifier.
Not all image formats supported by the device and platform are valid to be
passed to all of these access qualifiers.
For each access qualifier, only images whose format is in the list of
formats returned by {clGetSupportedImageFormats} with the given flag
arguments in the <<image-format-mapping-table,Image Format Mapping>> table
are permitted.
It is not valid to pass an image supporting writing as both a `read_only`
image and a `write_only` image parameter, or to a `read_write` image
parameter and any other image parameter.

=== Mapping to External Image Formats

OpenCL image objects can be created which share storage with image objects
in external APIs such as DirectX and OpenGL when the corresponding OpenCL
extensions are supported.
When creating such OpenCL images, there are restrictions on the allowed
formats.
The tables in this section list, for each such external API, the supported
image formats in that API and the corresponding OpenCL image format.


ifdef::cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing[]
==== Image Formats for DirectX 9 Media Surface Sharing

When the {cl_khr_dx9_media_sharing_EXT} extension is supported, image
objects sharing storage with Direct3D 9 surfaces can be created.
This section describes the Direct3D 9 surface formats that are supported
when the adapter type is one of the Direct 3D lineage.
Using a Direct3D 9 surface format not listed here is an error.
To extend the use of this extension to support media adapters beyond DirectX
9 tables similar to the ones in this section will need to be defined for the
surface formats supported by the new media adapter.
All implementations that support this extension are required to support the
NV12 surface format.
The other surface formats supported are the same surface formats that the
adapter you are sharing with supports as long as they are listed in the
<<fourcc-image-formats-table, YUV FourCC Codes and Corresponding OpenCL
Image Formats>> or <<d3d9-image-formats-table, Direct3D 9 Formats and
Corresponding OpenCL Image Formats>> tables.

|====

In the <<fourcc-image-formats-table, YUV FourCC Codes and Corresponding
OpenCL Image Formats>> table, NV12 Plane 0 corresponds to the luminance (Y)
channel and Plane 1 corresponds to the UV channels. The YV12 Plane 0
corresponds to the Y channel, Plane 1 corresponds to the V channel and Plane
2 corresponds to the U channel.
Note that the YUV formats map to {CL_R} and {CL_RG} but do not perform any
YUV to RGB conversion, and vice-versa.

| `D3DFMT_X8R8G8B8`      | {CL_BGRA}, {CL_UNORM_INT8}
|====

NOTE: The Direct3D 9 format names in the table above seem to imply that the order
of the color channels are switched relative to OpenCL, but this is not the
case.
For example, the layout of channels for each pixel for
`D3DFMT_A32FB32FG32FR32F` is the same as {CL_RGBA}, {CL_FLOAT}.

ifdef::cl_khr_gl_sharing[]
==== Image Formats for OpenGL Texture and Renderbuffer Sharing

When the {cl_khr_gl_sharing_EXT} extension is supported, image objects
sharing storage with OpenGL texture and renderbuffer objects can be created.
The <<opengl-image-formats-table, OpenGL Internal Formats and Corresponding
OpenCL Internal Formats>> table describes the supported OpenGL image
formats.
If an OpenGL texture or renderbuffer object with an internal format from the
table is successfully created by OpenGL, then there is guaranteed to be a
mapping to one of the corresponding OpenCL image format(s) in the table.
Texture and renderbuffer objects created with other OpenGL internal formats
may (but are not guaranteed to) have a mapping to an OpenCL image format.
If such mappings exist, they are guaranteed to preserve all color
components, data types, and at least the number of bits/component actually
allocated by OpenGL for that format.

=== Reading, Writing and Copying Image Objects

[open,refpage='clEnqueueReadImage',desc='Enqueue commands to read from an image or image array object to host memory.',type='protos',alias='clEnqueueWriteImage']
--
The following functions enqueue commands to read from an image or image
array object to host memory or write to an image or image array object from
host memory.

include::{generated}/api/protos/clEnqueueReadImage.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clEnqueueReadImage.asciidoc[]

include::{generated}/api/protos/clEnqueueWriteImage.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clEnqueueWriteImage.asciidoc[]

  * _command_queue_ refers to the host command-queue in which the read / write
    command will be queued.
    _command_queue_ and _image_ must be created with the same OpenCL context.
  * _image_ refers to a valid image or image array object.
  * _blocking_read_ and _blocking_write_ indicate if the read and write
    operations are _blocking_ or _non-blocking_.
  * _origin_ defines the (_x_, _y_, _z_) offset in pixels in the 1D, 2D or 3D
    image, the (_x_, _y_) offset and the image index in the 2D image array or
    the (_x_) offset and the image index in the 1D image array.
    If _image_ is a 2D image object, _origin_[2] must be 0.
    If _image_ is a 1D image or 1D image buffer object, _origin_[1] and
    _origin_[2] must be 0.
    If _image_ is a 1D image array object, _origin_[2] must be 0.
    If _image_ is a 1D image array object, _origin_[1] describes the image index
    in the 1D image array.
    If _image_ is a 2D image array object, _origin_[2] describes the image index
    in the 2D image array.
  * _region_ defines the (_width_, _height_, _depth_) in pixels of the 1D, 2D or
    3D rectangle, the (_width_, _height_) in pixels of the 2D rectangle and the
    number of images of a 2D image array or the (_width_) in pixels of the 1D
    rectangle and the number of images of a 1D image array.
    If _image_ is a 2D image object, _region_[2] must be 1.
    If _image_ is a 1D image or 1D image buffer object, _region_[1] and
    _region_[2] must be 1.
    If _image_ is a 1D image array object, _region_[2] must be 1.
    The values in _region_ cannot be 0.
ifdef::cl_khr_mipmap_image[]
    If _image_ is a mipmapped image, the mip level to read or write is
    determined from _origin_ as described in <<image-mipmap-access,
    Specifying Mipmap Levels to Image Operations>>
endif::cl_khr_mipmap_image[]
  * _row_pitch_ in {clEnqueueReadImage} and _input_row_pitch_ in
    {clEnqueueWriteImage} is the length of each row in bytes.
    This value must be greater than or equal to the element size in bytes
    {times} _width_.
    If _row_pitch_ (or _input_row_pitch_) is set to 0, the appropriate row pitch
    is calculated based on the size of each element in bytes multiplied by
    _width_.
  * _slice_pitch_ in {clEnqueueReadImage} and _input_slice_pitch_ in
    {clEnqueueWriteImage} is the size in bytes of the 2D slice of the 3D region
    of a 3D image or each image of a 1D or 2D image array being read or written
    respectively.
    This must be 0 if _image_ is a 1D or 2D image.
    Otherwise this value must be greater than or equal to _row_pitch_ {times}
    _height_.
    If _slice_pitch_ (or _input_slice_pitch_) is set to 0, the appropriate slice
    pitch is calculated based on the _row_pitch_ {times} _height_.
  * _ptr_ is the pointer to a buffer in host memory where image data is to be
    read from or to be written to.
    The alignment requirements for ptr are specified in
    <<alignment-app-data-types,Alignment of Application Data Types>>.
  * _event_wait_list_ and _num_events_in_wait_list_ specify events that need to
    complete before this particular command can be executed.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then this particular command does not wait
    on any event to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
    If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0.
    The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as synchronization points.
    The context associated with events in _event_wait_list_ and _command_queue_
    must be the same.
    The memory associated with _event_wait_list_ can be reused or freed after
    the function returns.
  * _event_ returns an event object that identifies this read / write command
    and can be used to query or queue a wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_ is `NULL` or the enqueue is unsuccessful, no event will be
    created and therefore it will not be possible to query the status of this
    command or to wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ and _event_ are not `NULL`, _event_ must not refer
    to an element of the _event_wait_list_ array.

If _blocking_read_ is {CL_TRUE} i.e. the read command is blocking,
{clEnqueueReadImage} does not return until the buffer data has been read and
copied into memory pointed to by _ptr_.

If _blocking_read_ is {CL_FALSE} i.e. the read command is non-blocking,
{clEnqueueReadImage} queues a non-blocking read command and returns.
The contents of the buffer that _ptr_ points to cannot be used until the
read command has completed.
The _event_ argument returns an event object which can be used to query the
execution status of the read command.
When the read command has completed, the contents of the buffer that _ptr_
points to can be used by the application.

If _blocking_write_ is {CL_TRUE}, the write command is blocking and does not
return until the command is complete, including transfer of the data.
The memory pointed to by _ptr_ can be reused by the application after the
{clEnqueueWriteImage} call returns.

If _blocking_write_ is {CL_FALSE}, the OpenCL implementation will use _ptr_ to
perform a non-blocking write.
As the write is non-blocking the implementation can return immediately.
The memory pointed to by _ptr_ cannot be reused by the application after the
call returns.
The _event_ argument returns an event object which can be used to query the
execution status of the write command.
When the write command has completed, the memory pointed to by _ptr_ can
then be reused by the application.

=== Specifying Mipmap Levels to Image Operations

When the {cl_khr_mipmap_image_EXT} extension is supported, the
{clEnqueueReadImage}, {clEnqueueWriteImage}, {clEnqueueMapImage},
{clEnqueueCopyImage}, {clEnqueueCopyImageToBuffer},
{clEnqueueCopyBufferToImage}, and {clEnqueueFillImage} functions described
above can operate on mipmapped images.

The mipmap image level(s) to access for each command are determined from the
_origin_ parameter when accessing a single _image_ (non-copy functions), or
from the _src_origin_ and _dst_origin_ parameters when accessing two
_src_image_ and _dst_image_ images (copy functions). The logic below applies
to each of these parameters, with _image_ and _origin_ replaced by
_src_image_ and _src_origin_, or _dst_image_ and _dst_origin_ as
appropriate:

  * If _image_ is a 1D image, _origin_[1] specifies the mip level to use.
  * If _image_ is a 1D image array, _origin_[2] specifies the mip level to
    use.
  * If _image_ is a 2D image, _origin_[2] specifies the mip level to use.
  * If _image_ is a 2D image array or a 3D image, _origin_[3] specifies the
    mip level to use.

==== Restrictions on Depth/Stencil Images

Depth images with an image channel order of {CL_DEPTH_STENCIL} can only be
created using the {clCreateFromGLTexture} API, and only when the
{cl_khr_gl_depth_images_EXT} extension is supported.

For the image format given by channel order of {CL_DEPTH_STENCIL} and
channel data type of {CL_UNORM_INT24}, the depth is stored as an unsigned
normalized 24-bit value.

For the image format given by channel order of {CL_DEPTH_STENCIL} and
channel data type of {CL_FLOAT}, each pixel is two 32-bit values.
The depth is stored as a single precision floating-point value followed by
the stencil which is stored as a 8-bit integer value.

Such images appear in the <<minimum-list-of-supported-image-formats,]
Minimum List of Supported Image Formats>>, but only require read support,
not write support.

The stencil value cannot be read or written using the *read_imagef* and
*write_imagef* built-in functions in an OpenCL kernel.

Depth image objects with an image channel order of {CL_DEPTH_STENCIL} cannot
be used as arguments to {clEnqueueReadImage}, {clEnqueueWriteImage},
{clEnqueueCopyImage}, {clEnqueueCopyImageToBuffer},
{clEnqueueCopyBufferToImage}, {clEnqueueMapImage}, and {clEnqueueFillImage}.
Such use will return a {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} error.

If an OpenGL renderbuffer object with an internal format from the table is
successfully created by OpenGL, then there is guaranteed to be a mapping to
one of the corresponding OpenCL image format(s) in that table.
Renderbuffer objects created with other OpenGL internal formats may (but are

== Pipes

NOTE: Pipes are <<unified-spec, missing before>> version 2.0.

A _pipe_ is a memory object that stores data organized as a FIFO.
Pipe objects can only be accessed using built-in functions that read from
and write to a pipe.
Pipe objects are not accessible from the host.
A pipe object encapsulates the following information:

  * Packet size in bytes
  * Maximum capacity in packets
  * Information about the number of packets currently in the pipe
  * Data packets


=== Creating Pipe Objects

  * _flags_ is a bit-field that is used to specify allocation and usage
    information such as the memory arena that should be used to allocate the
    pipe object and how it will be used.
    The <<memory-flags,Memory Flags>> table describes the possible values for
    _flags_.
    Only {CL_MEM_READ_WRITE} and {CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS} can be specified when
    creating a pipe object.
    If the value specified for _flags_ is 0, the default is used which is
    {CL_MEM_READ_WRITE} | {CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS}.
  * _pipe_packet_size_ is the size in bytes of a pipe packet.
  * _pipe_max_packets_ specifies the pipe capacity by specifying the maximum
    number of packets the pipe can hold.
  * _properties_ specifies a list of properties for the pipe and their
    corresponding values.
    Each property name is immediately followed by the corresponding desired
    value.
    The list is terminated with 0.
    Currently, in all OpenCL versions, _properties_ must be `NULL`.
  * _errcode_ret_ will return an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

// refError

{clCreatePipe} returns a valid non-zero pipe object and _errcode_ret_ is set
to {CL_SUCCESS} if the pipe object is created successfully.
Otherwise, it returns a `NULL` value with one of the following error values
returned in _errcode_ret_:

  * {CL_INVALID_CONTEXT} if _context_ is not a valid context.
  * {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if no devices in _context_ support pipes.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if values specified in _flags_ are not as defined
    above.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _properties_ is not `NULL`.
  * {CL_INVALID_PIPE_SIZE} if _pipe_packet_size_ is 0 or the
    _pipe_packet_size_ exceeds {CL_DEVICE_PIPE_MAX_PACKET_SIZE} value
    specified in the <<device-queries-table,Device Queries>> table for all
    devices in _context_ or if _pipe_max_packets_ is 0.
  * {CL_MEM_OBJECT_ALLOCATION_FAILURE} if there is a failure to allocate
    memory for the pipe object.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

endif::cl_ext_immutable_memory_objects[]

Pipes follow the same memory consistency model as defined for buffer and
image objects.
The pipe state i.e. contents of the pipe across kernel-instances (on the
same or different devices) is enforced at a synchronization point.

To retain a memory object, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clRetainMemObject.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clRetainMemObject.asciidoc[]

  * _memobj_ specifies the memory object to be retained.

The _memobj_ reference count is incremented.

// refError

{clRetainMemObject} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT} if _memobj_ is not a valid memory object (buffer
    or image object).
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

{clCreateBuffer}, {clCreateBufferWithProperties}, {clCreateSubBuffer},
{clCreateImage}, {clCreateImageWithProperties}, {clCreateImage2D},

  * _memobj_ specifies the memory object to be released.

The _memobj_ reference count is decremented.

// refError

{clReleaseMemObject} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT} if _memobj_ is not a valid memory object.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

After the _memobj_ reference count becomes zero and commands queued for
execution on a command-queue(s) that use _memobj_ have finished, the memory
object is deleted.
If _memobj_ is a buffer object, _memobj_ cannot be deleted until all
sub-buffer objects associated with _memobj_ are deleted.
Using this function to release a reference that was not obtained by creating
the object or by calling {clRetainMemObject} causes undefined behavior.

[open,refpage='clSetMemObjectDestructorCallback',desc='Registers a destructor callback function with a memory object.',type='protos']
--
To register a callback function with a memory object that is called when
the memory object is destroyed, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clSetMemObjectDestructorCallback.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clSetMemObjectDestructorCallback.asciidoc[]

  * _memobj_ specifies the memory object to register the callback to.
  * _pfn_notify_ is the callback function to register.
    This callback function may be called asynchronously by the OpenCL
    implementation.
    It is the application's responsibility to ensure that the callback function
    is thread-safe.
    The parameters to this callback function are:
  ** _memobj_ is the memory object being deleted.
     When the callback function is called by the implementation, this memory
     object is not longer valid.
     _memobj_ is only provided for reference purposes.
  ** _user_data_ is a pointer to user-supplied data.
  * _user_data_ will be passed as the _user_data_ argument when _pfn_notify_ is
    called.
    _user_data_ can be `NULL`.

Each call to {clSetMemObjectDestructorCallback} registers the specified
callback function on a destructor callback stack associated with _memobj_.
The registered callback functions are called in the reverse order in
which they were registered.
The registered callback functions are called and then the memory object's
resources are freed and the memory object is deleted.
Therefore, the memory object destructor callback provides a mechanism for
an application to safely re-use or free a _host_ptr_ that was specified when
_memobj_ was created and used as the storage bits for the memory object.

// refError

{clSetMemObjectDestructorCallback} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is
executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT} if _memobj_ is not a valid memory object.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _pfn_notify_ is `NULL`.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

[[callback-functions]]
[NOTE]
====
When the user callback function is called by the implementation, the
contents of the memory region pointed to by _host_ptr_ (if the memory object
is created with {CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR}) are undefined.
The callback function is typically used by the application to either free or
reuse the memory region pointed to by _host_ptr_.

The behavior of calling expensive system routines, OpenCL API calls to
create contexts or command-queues, or blocking OpenCL operations from the
following list below, in a callback is undefined.

  * {clFinish},
  * {clWaitForEvents},
  * blocking calls to {clEnqueueReadBuffer}, {clEnqueueReadBufferRect},
    {clEnqueueWriteBuffer}, {clEnqueueWriteBufferRect},
  * blocking calls to {clEnqueueReadImage} and {clEnqueueWriteImage},
  * blocking calls to {clEnqueueMapBuffer}, {clEnqueueMapImage},
  * blocking calls to {clBuildProgram}, {clCompileProgram} or
    {clLinkProgram}

If an application needs to wait for completion of a routine from the above
list in a callback, please use the non-blocking form of the function, and
assign a completion callback to it to do the remainder of your work.
Note that when a callback (or other code) enqueues commands to a
command-queue, the commands are not required to begin execution until the
queue is flushed.
In standard usage, blocking enqueue calls serve this role by implicitly
flushing the queue.
Since blocking calls are not permitted in callbacks, those callbacks that
enqueue commands on a command-queue should either call {clFlush} on the
queue before returning or arrange for {clFlush} to be called later on
another thread.

The user callback function may not call OpenCL APIs with the memory object
for which the callback function is invoked and for such cases the behavior
of OpenCL APIs is considered to be undefined.

Applications must acquire the memory objects that are created using external
handles before they can be used by any OpenCL commands queued to a
command-queue.
Behavior is undefined if a memory object created from an external memory
handle is used by an OpenCL command queued to a command-queue without being
acquired.
This is to guarantee that the state of the memory objects is up-to-date and
they are accessible to OpenCL.

The following restrictions shall apply:

  * Each memory object must be acquired only once. Acquiring a memory object

[[external-memory-handle-types]]
=== Descriptions of External Memory Handle Types

This section describes external memory handle types that are added by
extensions.

Applications can import the same payload into multiple OpenCL contexts and
multiple times into a given OpenCL context. In all cases, each import
operation must create a distinct memory object.


==== File Descriptor Handle Types

ifdef::cl_khr_external_memory_opaque_fd[]
The {cl_khr_external_memory_opaque_fd_EXT} extension extends
{cl_external_memory_handle_type_khr_TYPE} to support the following new types
of handles, and adds as a property that may be specified when creating a
buffer or an image memory object from an external handle:

  * {CL_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_OPAQUE_FD_KHR_anchor} specifies a POSIX file
    descriptor handle that has only limited valid usage outside of OpenCL
    and other compatible APIs.
    It must be compatible with the POSIX system calls `dup`, `dup2`,
    `close`, and the non-standard system call `dup3`.
    Additionally, it must be transportable over a socket using a
    `SCM_RIGHTS` control message.
    It owns a reference to the underlying memory resource represented by its
    memory object.
endif::cl_khr_external_memory_opaque_fd[]

ifdef::cl_khr_external_memory_dma_buf[]
The {cl_khr_external_memory_dma_buf_EXT} extension extends
{cl_external_memory_handle_type_khr_TYPE} to support the following types of
handles, and adds as a property that may be specified when creating a buffer
or an image memory object from an external handle:

  * {CL_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_DMA_BUF_KHR_anchor} is a file descriptor for a Linux
    dma_buf. Once a memory object created from a dma_buf has been acquired with 
    {clEnqueueAcquireExternalMemObjectsKHR}, all access, including host access should 
    be done through OpenCL, until a call to {clEnqueueReleaseExternalMemObjectsKHR} has completed.
    Any operations external to OpenCL on the dma_buf while it is acquired 
    may result in undefined behavior.
    
    It owns a reference to the underlying memory resource represented by its
    memory object.
endif::cl_khr_external_memory_dma_buf[]

For these extensions, importing memory from a file descriptor transfers
ownership of the file descriptor from the application to the OpenCL
implementation.
The application must not perform any operations on the file descriptor after
a successful import.
The imported memory object holds a reference to its payload.


==== NT Handle Types

ifdef::cl_khr_external_memory_win32[]
The {cl_khr_external_memory_win32_EXT} extension extends
{cl_external_memory_handle_type_khr_TYPE} to support the following new types
of handles, and adds as a property that may be specified when creating a
buffer or an image memory object from an external handle:

  * {CL_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_OPAQUE_WIN32_KHR_anchor} specifies an NT handle that
    has only limited valid usage outside of OpenCL and other compatible
    APIs.
    It must be compatible with the functions `DuplicateHandle`,
    `CloseHandle`, `CompareObjectHandles`, `GetHandleInformation`, and
    `SetHandleInformation`.
    It owns a reference to the underlying memory resource represented by its
    memory object.
  * {CL_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_OPAQUE_WIN32_KMT_KHR_anchor} specifies a global
    share handle that has only limited valid usage outside of OpenCL and
    other compatible APIs.
    It is not compatible with any native APIs.
    It does not own a reference to the underlying memory resource
    represented by its memory object, and will therefore become invalid when
    all memory objects associated with it are destroyed.
  * {CL_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_OPAQUE_WIN32_NAME_KHR_anchor} specifies an NT handle name that
    has only limited valid usage outside of OpenCL and other compatible
    APIs.
    NT handle name is a null-terminated UTF-16 string naming the payload to import.
    It must be compatible with the functions `DuplicateHandle`,
    `CloseHandle`, `CompareObjectHandles`, `GetHandleInformation`, and
    `SetHandleInformation`.
    It owns a reference to the underlying memory resource represented by its
    memory object.

endif::cl_khr_external_memory_win32[]

For these extensions, importing memory object payloads from Windows handles
does not transfer ownership of the handle to the OpenCL implementation.
For handle types defined as NT handles, the application must release handle
ownership using the CloseHandle system call when the handle is no longer
needed.
For handle types defined as NT handles, the imported memory object holds a
reference to its payload.

Note: Non-NT handle import operations do not add a reference to their
associated payload.
If the original object owning the payload is destroyed, all resources and
handles sharing that payload will become invalid.

endif::cl_khr_external_memory[]


[[unmapping-mapped-memory]]
=== Unmapping Mapped Memory Objects

[open,refpage='clEnqueueUnmapMemObject',desc='Enqueues a command to unmap a previously mapped region of a memory object.',type='protos']
--
To enqueue a command to unmap a previously mapped region of a memory object,
call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clEnqueueUnmapMemObject.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clEnqueueUnmapMemObject.asciidoc[]

  * _command_queue_ must be a valid host command-queue.
  * _memobj_ is a valid memory (buffer or image) object.
    The OpenCL context associated with _command_queue_ and _memobj_ must be the
    same.
  * _mapped_ptr_ is the host address returned by a previous call to
    {clEnqueueMapBuffer}, or {clEnqueueMapImage} for _memobj_.
  * _event_wait_list_ and _num_events_in_wait_list_ specify events that need to
    complete before {clEnqueueUnmapMemObject} can be executed.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then {clEnqueueUnmapMemObject} does not wait
    on any event to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
    If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0.
    The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as synchronization points.
    The context associated with events in _event_wait_list_ and _command_queue_
    must be the same.
    The memory associated with _event_wait_list_ can be reused or freed after
    the function returns.
  * _event_ returns an event object that identifies this command and
    can be used to query or queue a wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_ is `NULL` or the enqueue is unsuccessful, no event will be
    created and therefore it will not be possible to query the status of this
    command or to wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ and _event_ are not `NULL`, _event_ must not refer
    to an element of the _event_wait_list_ array.

Reads or writes from the host using the pointer returned by
{clEnqueueMapBuffer} or {clEnqueueMapImage} are considered to be complete.

{clEnqueueMapBuffer} and {clEnqueueMapImage} increment the mapped count of
the memory object.
The initial mapped count value of the memory object is zero.
Multiple calls to {clEnqueueMapBuffer}, or {clEnqueueMapImage} on the same
memory object will increment this mapped count by appropriate number of
calls.
{clEnqueueUnmapMemObject} decrements the mapped count of the memory object.

{clEnqueueMapBuffer}, and {clEnqueueMapImage} act as synchronization points
for a region of the buffer object being mapped.

// refError

{clEnqueueUnmapMemObject} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE} if _command_queue_ is not a valid host
    command-queue.
  * {CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT} if _memobj_ is not a valid memory object or is a
    pipe object.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _mapped_ptr_ is not a valid pointer returned by
    {clEnqueueMapBuffer} or {clEnqueueMapImage} for _memobj_.
  * {CL_INVALID_EVENT_WAIT_LIST} if _event_wait_list_ is `NULL` and
    _num_events_in_wait_list_ > 0, or if _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL` and
    _num_events_in_wait_list_ is 0, or if event objects in _event_wait_list_
    are not valid events.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
  * {CL_INVALID_CONTEXT} if context associated with _command_queue_ and
    _memobj_ are not the same or if the context associated with
    _command_queue_ and events in _event_wait_list_ are not the same.
--


[[accessing-mapped-regions]]
=== Accessing Mapped Regions of a Memory Object

This section describes the behavior of OpenCL commands that access mapped
regions of a memory object.

The contents of the region of a memory object and associated memory objects
(sub-buffer objects or 1D image buffer objects that overlap this region)
mapped for writing (i.e. {CL_MAP_WRITE} or {CL_MAP_WRITE_INVALIDATE_REGION} is
set in _map_flags_ argument to {clEnqueueMapBuffer}, or {clEnqueueMapImage})
are considered to be undefined until this region is unmapped.

Multiple commands in command-queues can map a region or overlapping regions
of a memory object and associated memory objects (sub-buffer objects or 1D
image buffer objects that overlap this region) for reading (i.e. _map_flags_
= {CL_MAP_READ}).
The contents of the regions of a memory object mapped for reading can also
be read by kernels and other OpenCL commands (such as {clEnqueueCopyBuffer})
executing on a device(s).

Mapping (and unmapping) overlapped regions in a memory object and/or
associated memory objects (sub-buffer objects or 1D image buffer objects
that overlap this region) for writing is an error and will result in
{CL_INVALID_OPERATION} error returned by {clEnqueueMapBuffer}, or
{clEnqueueMapImage}.

If a memory object is currently mapped for writing, the application must
ensure that the memory object is unmapped before any enqueued kernels or
commands that read from or write to this memory object or any of its
associated memory objects (sub-buffer or 1D image buffer objects) or its
parent object (if the memory object is a sub-buffer or 1D image buffer
object) begin execution; otherwise the behavior is undefined.

If a memory object is currently mapped for reading, the application must
ensure that the memory object is unmapped before any enqueued kernels or
commands that write to this memory object or any of its associated memory
objects (sub-buffer or 1D image buffer objects) or its parent object (if the
memory object is a sub-buffer or 1D image buffer object) begin execution;
otherwise the behavior is undefined.

A memory object is considered as mapped if there are one or more active
mappings for the memory object irrespective of whether the mapped regions
span the entire memory object.

Accessing the contents of the memory region referred to by the mapped
pointer that has been unmapped is undefined.

The mapped pointer returned by {clEnqueueMapBuffer} or {clEnqueueMapImage}
can be used as the _ptr_ argument value to {clEnqueueReadBuffer},
{clEnqueueWriteBuffer}, {clEnqueueReadBufferRect},
{clEnqueueWriteBufferRect}, {clEnqueueReadImage}, or
{clEnqueueWriteImage} provided the rules described above are adhered to.


=== Migrating Memory Objects

NOTE: Migrating memory objects is <<unified-spec, missing before>> version 1.2.

This section describes a mechanism for assigning which device an OpenCL
memory object resides.
A user may wish to have more explicit control over the location of their
memory objects on creation.
This could be used to:

  * Ensure that an object is allocated on a specific device prior to usage.
  * Preemptively migrate an object from one device to another.

To enqueue a command to indicate which device a set of memory objects should
be associated with, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clEnqueueMigrateMemObjects.txt[]

  * _command_queue_ is a valid host command-queue.
    The specified set of memory objects in _mem_objects_ will be migrated to the
    OpenCL device associated with _command_queue_ or to the host if the
    {CL_MIGRATE_MEM_OBJECT_HOST} has been specified.
  * _num_mem_objects_ is the number of memory objects specified in
    _mem_objects_.
  * _mem_objects_ is a pointer to a list of memory objects.
  * _flags_ is a bit-field that is used to specify migration options.
    The <<migration-flags-table,Memory Migration Flags>> describes the possible
    values for flags.
  * _event_wait_list_ and _num_events_in_wait_list_ specify events that need to
    complete before this particular command can be executed.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then this particular command does not wait
    on any event to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
    If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0.
    The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as synchronization points.
    The context associated with events in _event_wait_list_ and _command_queue_
    must be the same.
    The memory associated with _event_wait_list_ can be reused or freed after
    the function returns.
  * _event_ returns an event object that identifies this command and
    can be used to query or queue a wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_ is `NULL` or the enqueue is unsuccessful, no event will be
    created and therefore it will not be possible to query the status of this
    command or to wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ and _event_ are not `NULL`, _event_ must not refer
    to an element of the _event_wait_list_ array.

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",options="header"]
|====
| Memory Migration Flags | Description
| {CL_MIGRATE_MEM_OBJECT_HOST_anchor}

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/CL_MIGRATE_MEM_OBJECT_HOST.asciidoc[]
  | This flag indicates that the specified set of memory objects are to be
    migrated to the host, regardless of the target command-queue.
| {CL_MIGRATE_MEM_OBJECT_CONTENT_UNDEFINED_anchor}

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/CL_MIGRATE_MEM_OBJECT_CONTENT_UNDEFINED.asciidoc[]
  | This flag indicates that the contents of the set of memory objects are
    undefined after migration.
    The specified set of memory objects are migrated to the device
    associated with _command_queue_ without incurring the overhead of
    migrating their contents.
|====

Typically, memory objects are implicitly migrated to a device for which
enqueued commands, using the memory object, are targeted.
{clEnqueueMigrateMemObjects} allows this migration to be explicitly
performed ahead of the dependent commands.
This allows a user to preemptively change the association of a memory
object, through regular command-queue scheduling, in order to prepare for
another upcoming command.
This also permits an application to overlap the placement of memory objects
with other unrelated operations before these memory objects are needed
potentially hiding transfer latencies.
Once the event, returned from {clEnqueueMigrateMemObjects}, has been marked
{CL_COMPLETE} the memory objects specified in _mem_objects_ have been
successfully migrated to the device associated with _command_queue_.
The migrated memory object shall remain resident on the device until another
command is enqueued that either implicitly or explicitly migrates it away.

{clEnqueueMigrateMemObjects} can also be used to direct the initial
placement of a memory object, after creation, possibly avoiding the initial
overhead of instantiating the object on the first enqueued command to use
it.

The user is responsible for managing the event dependencies, associated with
this command, in order to avoid overlapping access to memory objects.
Improperly specified event dependencies passed to
{clEnqueueMigrateMemObjects} could result in undefined results.

// refError

{clEnqueueMigrateMemObjects} return {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed

    memory objects in _mem_objects_ are not the same or if the context

  * {CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT} if any of the memory objects in _mem_objects_ is
    not a valid memory object.

OpenCL memory objects created from media surfaces which have been acquired
by OpenCL must be released by OpenCL before they may be accessed by the
media adapter API.
Accessing a media surface while its corresponding OpenCL memory object is

termination.

==== Synchronizing Access to Memory Objects Shared With EGL or OpenGL

When sharing objects such as EGL images (if the {cl_khr_egl_image_EXT}
extension is supported) or OpenGL buffers, textures, and renderbuffers (if
the {cl_khr_gl_sharing_EXT} extension is supported), in order to ensure data
integrity, the application is responsible for synchronizing access to shared
memory objects through the other API with which such objects are shared.

Failure to provide such synchronization may result in race conditions and
other undefined behavior including non-portability between implementations.

Prior to acquiring objects shared with the other API, the application must
ensure that any pending operations in that API which accesses the objects
specified in _mem_objects_ have completed.

Depending on the application and the implementation, there are two
extensions which may be used to synchronize with other APIs:


ifdef::cl_khr_egl_image[]
===== Synchronization With EGL and EGL Client APIs

When sharing with an EGL context via the {cl_khr_egl_image_EXT} extension,
if the {cl_khr_egl_event_EXT} extension is supported, and the EGL context in
question supports fence sync objects, _explicit synchronization_ with EGL or
EGL client APIs can be achieved as described in the
<<explicit-sync-using-egl-fences, Explicit Synchronization Using EGL Fence
Sync Objects>> section.

If the {cl_khr_egl_event_EXT} extension is not supported, completion of EGL
client API commands may be determined by issuing and waiting for completion
of commands such as `glFinish` or `vgFinish` on all client API contexts with
pending references to these objects.
endif::cl_khr_egl_image[]


ifdef::cl_khr_gl_sharing[]
===== Synchronization With OpenGL

When sharing with an OpenGL context via the {cl_khr_gl_sharing_EXT}
extension, the OpenCL implementation will ensure that any such pending
OpenGL operations are complete for an OpenGL context bound to the same
thread as the OpenCL context. This is referred to as _implicit
synchronization_.

If the {cl_khr_gl_event_EXT} extension is supported, and the OpenGL context
in question supports fence sync objects, _explicit synchronization_ with
OpenGL can be achieved as described in the <<explicit-sync-using-gl-fences,
Explicit Synchronization Using OpenGL Fence Sync Objects>> section.

If the {cl_khr_gl_event_EXT} extension is not supported, completion of
OpenGL commands may be determined by issuing and waiting for completion of a
`glFinish` command on all OpenGL contexts with pending references to these
objects.
endif::cl_khr_gl_sharing[]


===== General Considerations for Synchronization With Other APIs

Some implementations may offer other efficient synchronization methods. If
such methods exist they will be described in platform-specific
documentation.

Note that no synchronization method other than `glFinish` is portable
between all OpenGL implementations and all OpenCL implementations.
While this is the only way to ensure completion that is portable to all
platforms, `glFinish` is an expensive operation and its use should be
avoided if the {cl_khr_egl_event_EXT} or {cl_khr_gl_event_EXT} extensions
are supported on a platform.


===== Synchronizing OpenCL Operations With Other APIs

After releasing a shared memory object, the application is responsible for
ensuring that any pending OpenCL operations which access the objects specified
in _mem_objects_ have completed prior to executing subsequent commands in the
other API which reference these objects.

This may be accomplished portably by calling {clWaitForEvents} with the
event object returned by {clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects}, or by calling
{clFinish}.
As above, some implementations may offer more efficient methods.

The application is responsible for maintaining the proper order of
operations if the OpenCL context and the other API context are in separate
threads.

If an OpenGL context is bound to a thread other than the one in which
{clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects} is called, changes to any of the objects in
_mem_objects_ may not be visible to that context without additional steps
being taken by the application.
For an OpenGL 3.1 (or later) context, the requirements are described in
Appendix D ("`Shared Objects and Multiple Contexts`") of the OpenGL 3.1
Specification.
For prior versions of OpenGL, the requirements are implementation-dependent.

Attempting to access the data store of an OpenGL object after it has been
acquired by OpenCL and before it has been released will result in undefined
behavior.
Similarly, attempting to access a shared OpenCL/OpenGL object from OpenCL
before it has been acquired by the OpenCL command-queue, or after it has
been released, will result in undefined behavior.

== Shared Virtual Memory

NOTE: Shared virtual memory is <<unified-spec, missing before>> version 2.0.

Shared virtual memory (a.k.a. SVM) allows the host and kernels executing on
devices to directly share complex, pointer-containing data structures such as
trees and linked lists.
It also eliminates the need to marshal data between the host and devices.
As a result, SVM substantially simplifies OpenCL programming and may improve
performance.


=== SVM Sharing Granularity: Coarse- and Fine- Grained Sharing

OpenCL maintains memory consistency in a coarse-grained fashion in regions
of buffers.
We call this coarse-grained sharing.
Many platforms such as those with integrated CPU-GPU processors and ones
using the SVM-related PCI-SIG IOMMU services can do better, and can support
sharing at a granularity smaller than a buffer.
We call this fine-grained sharing.

  * Coarse-grained sharing: Coarse-grain sharing may be used for memory and
    virtual pointer sharing between multiple devices as well as between the
    host and one or more devices.
    The shared memory region is a memory buffer allocated using
    {clSVMAlloc}.
    Memory consistency is guaranteed at synchronization points and the host
    can use calls to {clEnqueueSVMMap} and {clEnqueueSVMUnmap} or create a
    {cl_mem_TYPE} buffer object using the SVM pointer and use OpenCL's existing host
    API functions {clEnqueueMapBuffer} and {clEnqueueUnmapMemObject} to
    update regions of the buffer.
    What coarse-grain buffer SVM adds to OpenCL's earlier buffer support are
    the ability to share virtual memory pointers and a guarantee that
    concurrent access to the same memory allocation from multiple kernels on
    a single device is valid.
    The coarse-grain buffer SVM provides a memory consistency model similar
    to the global memory consistency model described in _sections 3.3.1_ and
    _3.4.3_ of the OpenCL 1.2 specification.
    This memory consistency applies to the regions of buffers being shared
    in a coarse-grained fashion.
    It is enforced at the synchronization points between commands enqueued
    to command-queues in a single context with the additional consideration
    that multiple kernels concurrently running on the same device may safely
    share the data.
  * Fine-grained sharing: Shared virtual memory where memory consistency is
    maintained at a granularity smaller than a buffer.
    How fine-grained SVM is used depends on whether the device supports SVM
    atomic operations.
  ** If SVM atomic operations are supported, they provide memory consistency
     for loads and stores by the host and kernels executing on devices
     supporting SVM.
     This means that the host and devices can concurrently read and update
     the same memory.
     The consistency provided by SVM atomics is in addition to the
     consistency provided at synchronization points.
     There is no need for explicit calls to {clEnqueueSVMMap} and
     {clEnqueueSVMUnmap} or {clEnqueueMapBuffer} and
     {clEnqueueUnmapMemObject} on a {cl_mem_TYPE} buffer object created using the
     SVM pointer.
  ** If SVM atomic operations are not supported, the host and devices can
     concurrently read the same memory locations and can concurrently update
     non-overlapping memory regions, but attempts to update the same memory
     locations are undefined.
     Memory consistency is guaranteed at synchronization points without the
     need for explicit calls to {clEnqueueSVMMap} and {clEnqueueSVMUnmap}
     or {clEnqueueMapBuffer} and {clEnqueueUnmapMemObject} on a {cl_mem_TYPE}
     buffer object created using the SVM pointer.
  * There are two kinds of fine-grain sharing support.
    Devices may support either fine-grain buffer sharing or fine-grain
    system sharing.
  ** Fine-grain buffer sharing provides fine-grain SVM only within buffers
     and is an extension of coarse-grain sharing.
     To support fine-grain buffer sharing in an OpenCL context, all devices
     in the context must support {CL_DEVICE_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_BUFFER}.
  ** Fine-grain system sharing enables fine-grain sharing of the host's
     entire virtual memory, including memory regions allocated by the system
     *malloc* API.
     OpenCL buffer objects are unnecessary and programmers can pass pointers
     allocated using *malloc* to OpenCL kernels.

As an illustration of fine-grain SVM using SVM atomic operations to maintain
memory consistency, consider the following example.
The host and a set of devices can simultaneously access and update a shared
work-queue data structure holding work-items to be done.
The host can use atomic operations to insert new work-items into the queue
at the same time as the devices using similar atomic operations to remove
work-items for processing.

It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that no host code or
executing kernels attempt to access a shared memory region after that memory
is freed.
We require the SVM implementation to work with either 32- or 64- bit host
applications subject to the following requirement: the address space size
must be the same for the host and all OpenCL devices in the context.

  * _context_ is a valid OpenCL context used to create the SVM buffer.

  * _alignment_ is the minimum alignment in bytes that is required for the newly

    It must be a power of two up to the largest data type supported by the
    OpenCL device.
    For the full profile, the largest data type is long16.
    For the embedded profile, it is long16 if the device supports 64-bit
    integers; otherwise it is int16.
    If alignment is 0, a default alignment will be used that is equal to the
    size of largest data type supported by the OpenCL implementation.

  | This flag specifies that the SVM buffer will be read and written by a
    kernel.
    This is the default.
| {CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY}
  | This flag specifies that the SVM buffer will be written but not read by
    a kernel.

    Reading from a SVM buffer created with {CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY} inside a kernel
    is undefined.

    {CL_MEM_READ_WRITE} and {CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY} are mutually exclusive.
| {CL_MEM_READ_ONLY}
  | This flag specifies that the SVM buffer object is a read-only memory
    object when used inside a kernel.

    Writing to a SVM buffer created with {CL_MEM_READ_ONLY} inside a kernel is
    undefined.

    {CL_MEM_READ_WRITE} or {CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY} and {CL_MEM_READ_ONLY} are mutually

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/CL_MEM_SVM_ATOMICS.asciidoc[]
  | This flag is valid only if {CL_MEM_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_BUFFER} is specified in
    flags.
    It is used to indicate that SVM atomic operations can control visibility
    of memory accesses in this SVM buffer.
|====

If {CL_MEM_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_BUFFER} is not specified, the buffer can be created
as a coarse grained SVM allocation.
Similarly, if {CL_MEM_SVM_ATOMICS} is not specified, the buffer can be created
without support for SVM atomic operations (refer to an OpenCL kernel
language specifications).

Calling {clSVMAlloc} does not itself provide consistency for the shared
memory region.
When the host cannot use the SVM atomic operations, it must rely on OpenCL's
guaranteed memory consistency at synchronization points.

For SVM to be used efficiently, the host and any devices sharing a buffer
containing virtual memory pointers should have the same endianness.
If the context passed to {clSVMAlloc} has devices with mixed endianness and
the OpenCL implementation is unable to implement SVM because of that mixed
endianness, {clSVMAlloc} will fail and return `NULL`.

Although SVM is generally not supported for image objects, {clCreateImage}
and {clCreateImageWithProperties}
may create an image from a buffer (a 1D image from a buffer or a 2D image
from buffer) if the buffer specified in its image description parameter is a
SVM buffer.
Such images have a linear memory representation so their memory can be
shared using SVM.
However, fine grained sharing and atomics are not supported for image reads
and writes in a kernel.

  * _context_ is a valid OpenCL context used to create the SVM buffer.
    If no devices in _context_ support SVM, no action occurs.
  * _svm_pointer_ must be the value returned by a call to {clSVMAlloc}.
    If a `NULL` pointer is passed in _svm_pointer_, no action occurs.

Note that {clSVMFree} does not wait for previously enqueued commands that
may be using _svm_pointer_ to finish before freeing _svm_pointer_.
It is the responsibility of the application to make sure that enqueued
commands that use _svm_pointer_ have finished before freeing _svm_pointer_.
This can be done by enqueuing a blocking operation such as {clFinish},
{clWaitForEvents}, {clEnqueueReadBuffer} or by registering a callback with
the events associated with enqueued commands and when the last enqueued
command has finished freeing _svm_pointer_.

The behavior of using _svm_pointer_ after it has been freed is undefined.
In addition, if a buffer object is created using {clCreateBuffer} or
{clCreateBufferWithProperties} with _svm_pointer_, the buffer object must
first be released before the _svm_pointer_ is freed.

The {clEnqueueSVMFree} API can also be used to enqueue a callback to free

=== Memory Consistency for SVM Allocations

To ensure memory consistency in SVM allocations, the program can rely on the
guaranteed memory consistency at synchronization points.
This consistency support already exists in OpenCL 1.x and can be used for
coarse-grained SVM allocations or for fine-grained buffer SVM allocations;
what SVM adds is the ability to share pointers between the host and all SVM
devices.

In addition, sub-buffers can also be used to ensure that each device gets a
consistent view of a SVM buffers memory when it is shared by multiple
devices.
For example, assume that two devices share a SVM pointer.
The host can create a {cl_mem_TYPE} buffer object using {clCreateBuffer} or
{clCreateBufferWithProperties} with {CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR} and _host_ptr_ set
to the SVM pointer and then create two disjoint sub-buffers with starting
virtual addresses _sb1_ptr_ and _sb2_ptr_.
These pointers (_sb1_ptr_ and _sb2_ptr_) can be passed to kernels executing
on the two devices.
{clEnqueueMapBuffer} and {clEnqueueUnmapMemObject} and the existing
<<accessing-mapped-regions, access rules for memory objects>> ensure
consistency for buffer regions (_sb1_ptr_ and _sb2_ptr_) read and written by
these kernels.

When the host and devices are able to use SVM atomic operations (i.e.
{CL_DEVICE_SVM_ATOMICS} is set in {CL_DEVICE_SVM_CAPABILITIES}), these atomic
operations can be used to provide memory consistency at a fine grain in a
shared memory region.
The effect of these operations is visible to the host and all devices with
which that memory is shared.


== Sampler Objects

A sampler object describes how to sample an image when the image is read in
the kernel.
The built-in functions to read from an image in a kernel take a sampler as
an argument.
The sampler arguments to the image read function can be sampler objects
created using OpenCL functions and passed as argument values to the kernel
or can be samplers declared inside a kernel.
In this section we discuss how sampler objects are created using OpenCL
functions.

== Program Objects

An OpenCL program consists of a set of kernels that are identified as
functions declared with the `+__kernel+` qualifier in the program source.
OpenCL programs may also contain auxiliary functions and constant data that
can be used by kernel functions.
The program executable can be generated _online_ or _offline_ by the OpenCL
compiler for the appropriate target device(s).

A program object encapsulates the following information:

  * An associated context.
  * A program source or binary.
  * The latest successfully built program executable, library or compiled
    binary, the list of devices for which the program executable, library or
    compiled binary is built, the build options used and a build log.
  * The number of kernel objects currently attached.

  * _strings_ is an array of _count_ pointers to optionally null-terminated
    character strings that make up the source code.
  * _lengths_ argument is an array with the number of chars in each string
    (the string length).
    If an element in _lengths_ is zero, its accompanying string is
    null-terminated.
    If _lengths_ is `NULL`, all strings in the _strings_ argument are considered
    null-terminated.
    Any length value passed in that is greater than zero excludes the null
    terminator in its count.
  * _errcode_ret_ will return an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

The source code specified by _strings_ will be loaded into the program

  * Implementation-specific intermediate representation (IR) which will be

OpenCL allows applications to create a program object using the program
source or binary and build appropriate program executables.
This can be very useful as it allows applications to load program source and
then compile and link to generate a program executable online on its first

These executables can now be queried and cached by the application.
The cached executables can be read and loaded by the application, which can

     object is not longer valid.
     _program_ is only provided for reference purposes.
  ** _user_data_ is a pointer to user supplied data.
  * _user_data_ will be passed as the _user_data_ argument when _pfn_notify_ is
    called.
    _user_data_ can be `NULL`.

Each call to {clSetProgramReleaseCallback} registers the specified
callback function on a callback stack associated with _program_.
The registered callback functions are called in the reverse order in
which they were registered.
The registered callback functions are called after destructors (if any) for
program scope global variables (if any) are called and before the program
object is deleted.
This provides a mechanism for an application to be notified when destructors
for program scope global variables are complete.

// refError

{clSetProgramReleaseCallback} may unconditionally return an error if no
devices in the context associated with _program_ support destructors for
program scope global variables.
Support for constructors and destructors for program scope global variables
is required only for OpenCL 2.2 devices.

{clSetProgramReleaseCallback} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_PROGRAM} if _program_ is not a valid program object.
  * {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if no devices in the context associated with
    _program_ support destructors for program scope global variables.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _pfn_notify_ is `NULL`.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

=== Setting SPIR-V Specialization Constants

NOTE: Specialization constants are <<unified-spec, missing before>> version
2.2.

[open,refpage='clSetProgramSpecializationConstant',desc='',type='protos']
--
To set the value of a specialization constant, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clSetProgramSpecializationConstant.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clSetProgramSpecializationConstant.asciidoc[]

  * _program_ must be a valid OpenCL program created from an intermediate
    language (e.g. SPIR-V).
  * _spec_id_ identifies the specialization constant whose value will be
    set.
  * _spec_size_ specifies the size in bytes of the data pointed to by
    _spec_value_.
    This should be 1 for boolean constants.
    For all other constant types this should match the size of the
    specialization constant in the module.
  * _spec_value_ is a pointer to the memory location that contains the value of
    the specialization constant.
    The data pointed to by _spec_value_ are copied and can be safely reused by
    the application after {clSetProgramSpecializationConstant} returns.
    This specialization value will be used by subsequent calls to
    {clBuildProgram} until another call to {clSetProgramSpecializationConstant}
    changes it.
    If a specialization constant is a boolean constant, _spec_value_ should be a
    pointer to a {cl_uchar_TYPE} value.
    A value of zero will set the specialization constant to false; any other
    value will set it to true.

Calling this function multiple times for the same specialization constant
shall cause the last provided value to override any previously specified
value.
The values are used by a subsequent {clBuildProgram} call for the _program_.

Application is not required to provide values for every specialization
constant contained in the module. If the value is not set by this API
call, default values will be used during the build.

// refError

{clSetProgramSpecializationConstant} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is
executed successfully.

Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_PROGRAM} if _program_ is not a valid program object created
    from an intermediate language (e.g. SPIR-V), or if the intermediate
    language does not support specialization constants.
  * {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if no devices associated with _program_ support
    intermediate language programs.
  * {CL_COMPILER_NOT_AVAILABLE} if _program_ is created with
    {clCreateProgramWithIL} and a compiler is not
    available, i.e. {CL_DEVICE_COMPILER_AVAILABLE} specified in the
    <<device-queries-table,Device Queries>> table is set to {CL_FALSE}.
  * {CL_INVALID_SPEC_ID} if _spec_id_ is not a valid specialization constant
    identifier.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _spec_size_ does not match the size of the
    specialization constant in the module, or if _spec_value_ is
    `NULL`.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

=== Building Program Executables

[open,refpage='clBuildProgram',desc='Builds (compiles and links) a program executable from the program source or binary.',type='protos']
--
To build (compile & link) a program executable, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clBuildProgram.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clBuildProgram.asciidoc[]

  * _program_ is the program object.
  * _device_list_ is a pointer to a list of devices associated with _program_.
    If _device_list_ is a `NULL` value, the program executable is built for all
    devices associated with _program_ for which a source or binary has been
    loaded.
    If _device_list_ is a non-`NULL` value, the program executable is built for
    devices specified in this list for which a source or binary has been loaded.
  * _num_devices_ is the number of devices listed in _device_list_.
  * _options_ is a pointer to a null-terminated string of characters that
    describes the build options to be used for building the program executable.
    The list of supported options is described in <<compiler-options, Compiler
    Options>>.
    If the program was created using {clCreateProgramWithBinary} and _options_
    is a `NULL` pointer, the program will be built as if _options_ were the same
    as when the program binary was originally built.
    If the program was created using {clCreateProgramWithBinary} and _options_
    string contains anything other than the same options in the same order
    (whitespace ignored) as when the program binary was originally built, then
    the behavior is implementation-defined.
    Otherwise, if _options_ is a `NULL` pointer then it will have the same
    result as the empty string.
  * _pfn_notify_ is a function pointer to a notification routine.
    The notification routine is a callback function that an application can
    register and which will be called when the program executable has been built
    (successfully or unsuccessfully).
    If _pfn_notify_ is not `NULL`, {clBuildProgram} does not need to wait for
    the build to complete and can return immediately once the build operation
    can begin.
    Any state changes of the program object that result from calling
    {clBuildProgram} (e.g. build status or log) will be observable from this
    callback function.
    The build operation can begin if the context, program whose sources are
    being compiled and linked, list of devices and build options specified are
    all valid and appropriate host and device resources needed to perform the
    build are available.
    If _pfn_notify_ is `NULL`, {clBuildProgram} does not return until the build
    has completed.
    This callback function may be called asynchronously by the OpenCL
    implementation.
    It is the application's responsibility to ensure that the callback function
    is thread-safe.
  * _user_data_ will be passed as an argument when _pfn_notify_ is called.
    _user_data_ can be `NULL`.

The program executable is built from the program source or binary for all
the devices, or a specific device(s) in the OpenCL context associated with
_program_.
OpenCL allows program executables to be built using the source or the
binary.
{clBuildProgram} must be called for _program_ created using
{clCreateProgramWithSource}, {clCreateProgramWithIL} or
{clCreateProgramWithBinary} to build the program executable for one or more
devices associated with _program_.
If _program_ is created with {clCreateProgramWithBinary}, then the program
binary must be an executable binary (not a compiled binary or library).

The executable binary can be queried using {clGetProgramInfo}(_program_,
{CL_PROGRAM_BINARIES}, ...) and can be specified to
{clCreateProgramWithBinary} to create a new program object.

// refError

{clBuildProgram} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_PROGRAM} if _program_ is not a valid program object.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _device_list_ is `NULL` and _num_devices_ is greater
    than zero, or if _device_list_ is not `NULL` and _num_devices_ is zero.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _pfn_notify_ is `NULL` but _user_data_ is not
    `NULL`.
  * {CL_INVALID_DEVICE} if any device in _device_list_ is not in
    the list of devices associated with _program_.
  * {CL_INVALID_BINARY} if _program_ is created with
    {clCreateProgramWithBinary} and devices listed in _device_list_ do not
    have a valid program binary loaded.
  * {CL_INVALID_BUILD_OPTIONS} if the build options specified by _options_ are
    invalid.
  * {CL_COMPILER_NOT_AVAILABLE} if _program_ is created with
ifdef::cl_khr_il_program[{clCreateProgramWithILKHR},]
    {clCreateProgramWithSource} or {clCreateProgramWithIL} and a compiler is
    not available, i.e. {CL_DEVICE_COMPILER_AVAILABLE} specified in the
    <<device-queries-table,Device Queries>> table is set to {CL_FALSE}.
  * {CL_BUILD_PROGRAM_FAILURE} if there is a failure to build the program
    executable.
    This error will be returned if {clBuildProgram} does not return until
    the build has completed.
  * {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if the build of a program executable for any of the
    devices listed in _device_list_ by a previous call to {clBuildProgram}
    for _program_ has not completed.
  * {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if there are kernel objects attached to _program_.
  * {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if _program_ was not created with
    {clCreateProgramWithSource}, {clCreateProgramWithIL} or
    {clCreateProgramWithBinary}.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

=== Separate Compilation and Linking of Programs

NOTE: Separate compilation and linking are <<unified-spec, missing before>>
version 1.2.

OpenCL programs are compiled and linked to support the following:

  * Separate compilation and link stages.
    Program sources can be compiled to generate a compiled binary object and
    linked in a separate stage with other compiled program objects to the
    program executable.
  * Embedded headers.
    In OpenCL 1.0 and 1.1, the I build option could be used to specify the
    list of directories to be searched for headers files that are included
    by a program source(s).
    OpenCL 1.2 extends this by allowing the header sources to come from
    program objects instead of just header files.
  * Libraries.
    The linker can be used to link compiled objects and libraries into a
    program executable or to create a library of compiled binaries.

[open,refpage='clCompileProgram',desc='Compiles a program\'s source for all the devices or a specific device(s) in the OpenCL context associated with a program.',type='protos']
--
To compile a program's source for all the devices or a specific device(s) in
the OpenCL context associated with the program, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCompileProgram.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clCompileProgram.asciidoc[]

  * _program_ is the program object that is the compilation target.
  * _device_list_ is a pointer to a list of devices associated with _program_.
    If _device_list_ is a `NULL` value, the compile is performed for all devices
    associated with _program_.
    If _device_list_ is a non-`NULL` value, the compile is performed for devices
    specified in this list.
  * _num_devices_ is the number of devices listed in _device_list_.
  * _options_ is a pointer to a null-terminated string of characters that
    describes the compilation options to be used for building the program
    executable.
    If _options_ is a `NULL` pointer then it will have the same result as the
    empty string.
    Certain options are ignored when _program_ is created with IL.
    The list of supported options is as described in <<compiler-options,
    Compiler Options>>.
  * _num_input_headers_ specifies the number of programs that describe headers
    in the array referenced by _input_headers_.
  * _input_headers_ is an array of program embedded headers created with
    {clCreateProgramWithSource}.
  * _header_include_names_ is an array that has a one to one correspondence with
    _input_headers_.
    Each entry in _header_include_names_ specifies the include name used by
    source in _program_ that comes from an embedded header.
    The corresponding entry in _input_headers_ identifies the program object
    which contains the header source to be used.
    The embedded headers are first searched before the headers in the list of
    directories specified by the `-I` compile option (as described in
    <<preprocessor-options, Preprocessor options>>).
    If multiple entries in _header_include_names_ refer to the same header name,
    the first one encountered will be used.
  * _pfn_notify_ is a function pointer to a notification routine.
    The notification routine is a callback function that an application can
    register and which will be called when the program executable has been built
    (successfully or unsuccessfully).
    If _pfn_notify_ is not `NULL`, {clCompileProgram} does not need to wait for
    the compiler to complete and can return immediately once the compilation can
    begin.
    Any state changes of the program object that result from calling
    {clCompileProgram} (e.g. compile status or log) will be observable from this
    callback function.
    The compilation can begin if the context, program whose sources are being
    compiled, list of devices, input headers, programs that describe input
    headers and compiler options specified are all valid and appropriate host
    and device resources needed to perform the compile are available.
    If _pfn_notify_ is `NULL`, {clCompileProgram} does not return until the
    compiler has completed.
    This callback function may be called asynchronously by the OpenCL
    implementation.
    It is the application's responsibility to ensure that the callback function
    is thread-safe.
  * _user_data_ will be passed as an argument when _pfn_notify_ is called.
    _user_data_ can be `NULL`.

The pre-processor runs before the program sources are compiled.
The compiled binary is built for all devices associated with _program_ or
the list of devices specified.
The compiled binary can be queried using {clGetProgramInfo}(_program_,
{CL_PROGRAM_BINARIES}, ...) and can be passed to {clCreateProgramWithBinary}
to create a new program object.

If _program_ was created using {clCreateProgramWithIL}, then
_num_input_headers_, _input_headers_, and _header_include_names_ are
ignored.

For example, consider the following program source:

[source,opencl_c]
----
#include <foo.h>
#include <mydir/myinc.h>
__kernel void
image_filter (int n, int m,
              __constant float *filter_weights,
              __read_only image2d_t src_image,
              __write_only image2d_t dst_image)
{
...
}
----

This kernel includes two headers foo.h and mydir/myinc.h.
The following describes how these headers can be passed as embedded headers
in program objects:

[source,opencl]
----
cl_program foo_pg = clCreateProgramWithSource(context,
    1, &foo_header_src, NULL, &err);
cl_program myinc_pg = clCreateProgramWithSource(context,
    1, &myinc_header_src, NULL, &err);

// lets assume the program source described above is given
// by program_A and is loaded via clCreateProgramWithSource
cl_program input_headers[2] = { foo_pg, myinc_pg };
char * input_header_names[2] = { foo.h, mydir/myinc.h };
clCompileProgram(program_A,
                 0, NULL, // num_devices & device_list
                 NULL,    // compile_options
                 2,       // num_input_headers
                 input_headers,
                 input_header_names,
                 NULL, NULL); // pfn_notify & user_data
----

// refError

{clCompileProgram} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_PROGRAM} if _program_ is not a valid program object.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _device_list_ is `NULL` and _num_devices_ is greater
    than zero, or if _device_list_ is not `NULL` and _num_devices_ is zero.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _num_input_headers_ is zero and

  * {CL_COMPILE_PROGRAM_FAILURE} if there is a failure to compile the program
    source.
    This error will be returned if {clCompileProgram} does not return until

    _user_data_ can be `NULL`.

If _pfn_notify_ is not `NULL`, {clLinkProgram} does not need to wait for the
linker to complete, and can return immediately once the linking operation can
begin.
Once the linker has completed, the _pfn_notify_ callback function is called
which returns the program object returned by {clLinkProgram}.
Any state changes of the program object that result from calling {clLinkProgram}
(e.g. link status or log) will be observable from this callback function.
This callback function may be called asynchronously by the OpenCL

If _pfn_notify_ is `NULL`, {clLinkProgram} does not return until the linker

[[compiler-options]]
=== Compiler Options

The compiler options are categorized as pre-processor options, options for
math intrinsics, options that control optimization and miscellaneous
options.
This specification defines a standard set of options that must be supported
by the compiler when building program executables online or offline from
OpenCL C/{cpp} or, where relevant, from an IL.
These may be extended by a set of vendor- or platform-specific options.


[[preprocessor-options]]
==== Preprocessor Options

These options control the OpenCL C/{cpp} preprocessor which is run on each
program source before actual compilation.
These options are ignored for programs created with IL.

`-D name` ::
    Predefine _name_ as a macro, with definition 1.

`-D name=definition` ::
    The contents of _definition_ are tokenized and processed as if they
    appeared during translation phase three in a `#define` directive.
    In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline
    characters.
+
--
`-D` options are processed in the order they are given in the _options_
argument to {clBuildProgram} or {clCompileProgram}.
Note that a space is required between the `-D` option and the symbol it
defines, otherwise behavior is implementation-defined.
--

`-I dir` ::
    Add the directory _dir_ to the list of directories to be searched for
    header files.
    _dir_ can optionally be enclosed in double quotes.
+
--
This option is not portable due to its dependency on host file system and

[[math-intrinsics-options]]
==== Math Intrinsics Options

These options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point arithmetic.
These options trade off between speed and correctness.

`-cl-single-precision-constant` ::
    This option forces implicit conversions of double-precision floating-point
    literals to single precision.
    This option is ignored for programs created with IL.

`-cl-denorms-are-zero` ::
    This option controls how single precision and double precision
    denormalized numbers are handled.
    If specified as a build option, the single precision denormalized
    numbers may be flushed to zero; double precision denormalized numbers
    may also be flushed to zero if the optional extension for double
    precision is supported.
    This is intended to be a performance hint and the OpenCL compiler can
    choose not to flush denorms to zero if the device supports single
    precision (or double precision) denormalized numbers.
+
--
This option is ignored for single precision numbers if the device does not
support single precision denormalized numbers i.e. {CL_FP_DENORM} bit is not
set in {CL_DEVICE_SINGLE_FP_CONFIG}.

This option is ignored for double precision numbers if the device does not
support double precision or if it does support double precision but not
double precision denormalized numbers i.e. {CL_FP_DENORM} bit is not set in
{CL_DEVICE_DOUBLE_FP_CONFIG}.

This flag only applies for scalar and vector single precision floating-point
variables and computations on these floating-point variables inside a
program.
It does not apply to reading from or writing to image objects.
--

`-cl-fp32-correctly-rounded-divide-sqrt` ::
    The `-cl-fp32-correctly-rounded-divide-sqrt` build option to
    {clBuildProgram} or {clCompileProgram} allows an application to specify
    that single precision floating-point divide (x/y and 1/x) and sqrt used
    in the program source are correctly rounded.
    If this build option is not specified, the minimum numerical accuracy of
    single precision floating-point divide and sqrt are as defined in the
    OpenCL C or OpenCL SPIR-V Environment specifications.
+
--
This build option can only be specified if the
{CL_FP_CORRECTLY_ROUNDED_DIVIDE_SQRT} is set in {CL_DEVICE_SINGLE_FP_CONFIG} (as
defined in the <<device-queries-table,Device Queries>> table) for devices
that the program is being build.
{clBuildProgram} or {clCompileProgram} will fail to compile the program for
a device if the `-cl-fp32-correctly-rounded-divide-sqrt` option is specified
and {CL_FP_CORRECTLY_ROUNDED_DIVIDE_SQRT} is not set for the device.

Note: This option is <<unified-spec, missing before>> version 1.2.
--


[[optimization-options]]
==== Optimization Options

These options control various sorts of optimizations.
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the
performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly
the ability to debug the program.

`-cl-opt-disable` ::
    This option disables all optimizations.
    The default is optimizations are enabled.

`-cl-strict-aliasing` ::
    This option allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules.
+
--
Note: This option is <<unified-spec, deprecated by>> version 1.1.
--

`-cl-uniform-work-group-size` ::
    This requires that the global work-size be a multiple of the work-group
    size specified to {clEnqueueNDRangeKernel}.
    Allow optimizations that are made possible by this restriction.
+
--
Note: This option is <<unified-spec, missing before>> version 2.0.
--

`-cl-no-subgroup-ifp` ::
    This indicates that kernels in this program do not require sub-groups to
    make independent forward progress.
    Allows optimizations that are made possible by this restriction.
    This option has no effect for devices that do not support independent
    forward progress for sub-groups.
+
--
Note: This option is <<unified-spec, missing before>> version 2.1.
--

The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point
arithmetic.
These options trade off between performance and correctness and must be
specifically enabled.
These options are not turned on by default since it can result in incorrect
output for programs which depend on an exact implementation of IEEE 754
rules/specifications for math functions.

`-cl-mad-enable` ::
    Allow `a * b + c` to be replaced by a *mad* instruction.
    The *mad* instruction may compute `a * b + c` with reduced accuracy
    in the embedded profile.
    See the OpenCL C or OpenCL SPIR-V Environment specification for accuracy
    details.
    On some hardware the *mad* instruction may provide better performance
    than the expanded computation.

`-cl-no-signed-zeros` ::
    Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore the
    signedness of zero.
    IEEE 754 arithmetic specifies the distinct behavior of `+0.0` and `-0.0`
    values, which then prohibits simplification of expressions such as `x
    {plus} 0.0` or `0.0 * x` (even with `-cl-finite-math-only`).
    This option implies that the sign of a zero result is not significant.

`-cl-unsafe-math-optimizations` ::
    Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume that
    arguments and results are valid, (b) may violate the IEEE 754 standard,
    (c) assume relaxed OpenCL numerical compliance requirements as defined
    in the unsafe math optimization section of the OpenCL C or OpenCL SPIR-V
    Environment specifications, and (d) may violate edge case behavior in the
    OpenCL C or OpenCL SPIR-V Environment specifications.
    This option includes the `-cl-no-signed-zeros`, `-cl-mad-enable`, and
    `-cl-denorms-are-zero` footnote:[{fn-unsafe-denorms-are-zero}] options.

`-cl-finite-math-only` ::
    Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume that
    arguments and results are not NaNs, +Inf, -Inf.
    This option may violate the OpenCL numerical compliance requirements for
    single precision and double precision floating-point, as well as edge
    case behavior.

`-cl-fast-relaxed-math` ::
    Sets the optimization options `-cl-finite-math-only` and
    `-cl-unsafe-math-optimizations`.
    This option causes the preprocessor macro `+__FAST_RELAXED_MATH__+` to
    be defined in the OpenCL program.


==== Options to Request or Suppress Warnings

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which are not
inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there may have been an
error.
The following language-independent options do not enable specific warnings
but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by the OpenCL compiler.
These options are ignored for programs created with IL.

`-w` ::
    Inhibit all warning messages.

`-Werror` ::
    Make all warnings into errors.


[[opencl-c-version]]
==== Options Controlling the OpenCL C Version

The following option controls the version of OpenCL C that the compiler
accepts.
These options are ignored for programs created with IL.

`-cl-std=` ::
    Determine the OpenCL C language version to use.
    A value for this option must be provided.
    Valid values are:
+
--
  * `CL1.1`: Support OpenCL C 1.1 language features defined in _section 6_ of
  the OpenCL 1.1 specification or in the unified OpenCL C specification.
  * `CL1.2`: Support OpenCL C 1.2 language features defined in _section 6_ of
  the OpenCL 1.2 specification or in the unified OpenCL C specification.
  * `CL2.0`: Support OpenCL C 2.0 language features defined in the OpenCL C 2.0
  specification or in the unified OpenCL C specification.
  * `CL3.0`: Support OpenCL C 3.0 language features defined in the unified
  OpenCL C specification.
--

Calls to {clBuildProgram} or {clCompileProgram} with the `-cl-std=CL1.1`
option *will fail* to compile the program for any devices with
{CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION} equal to OpenCL C 1.0 and when
{CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_ALL_VERSIONS} does not include OpenCL C 1.1.

Calls to {clBuildProgram} or {clCompileProgram} with the `-cl-std=CL1.2`
option *will fail* to compile the program for any devices with
{CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION} equal to OpenCL C 1.1 or earlier
and when {CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_ALL_VERSIONS} does not include OpenCL C 1.2.

Calls to {clBuildProgram} or {clCompileProgram} with the `-cl-std=CL2.0`
option *will fail* to compile the program for any devices with
{CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION} equal to OpenCL C 1.2 or earlier
and when {CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_ALL_VERSIONS} does not include OpenCL C 2.0.

Calls to {clBuildProgram} or {clCompileProgram} with the `-cl-std=CL3.0`
option *will fail* to compile the program for any devices with
{CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION} equal to OpenCL C 2.0 or earlier
and when {CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_ALL_VERSIONS} does not include OpenCL C 3.0.

If the `-cl-std` build option is not specified, the highest OpenCL C 1.x
language version supported by each device is used when compiling the program
for each device.
Applications are required to specify the `-cl-std=CL2.0` build option to
compile or build programs with OpenCL C 2.0 and the `-cl-std=CL3.0`
build option to compile or build programs with OpenCL C 3.0.


==== Options for Querying Kernel Argument Information

IMPORTANT: Querying for kernel argument information is <<unified-spec, missing
before>> version 1.2.

`-cl-kernel-arg-info` ::
    This option allows the compiler to store information about the arguments
    of a kernel(s) in the program executable.
    The argument information stored includes the argument name, its type,
    the address space and access qualifiers used.
    Refer to description of {clGetKernelArgInfo} on how to query this
    information.


==== Options for Debugging Your Program

IMPORTANT: Debugging options are <<unified-spec, missing before>> version 2.0.

`-g` ::
    This option can currently be used to generate additional errors for the
    built-in functions that allow you to enqueue commands on a device (refer
    to OpenCL kernel languages specifications).

ifdef::cl_ext_cxx_for_opencl[]
==== C++ for OpenCL

Applications may pass `-cl-std=CLC{pp}` to {clCompileProgram} or {clBuildProgram}
for programs created using {clCreateProgramWithSource} to request the program
be built as C++ for OpenCL.
endif::cl_ext_cxx_for_opencl[]

[[linker-options]]
=== Linker Options

NOTE: Linker options are <<unified-spec, missing before>> version 1.2.

This specification defines a standard set of linker options that must be
supported by the OpenCL C compiler when linking compiled programs online or
offline.
These linker options are categorized as library linking options and program
linking options.
These may be extended by a set of vendor- or platform-specific options.


==== Library Linking Options

IMPORTANT: Library linking options are <<unified-spec, missing before>> version
1.2.

The following options can be specified when creating a library of compiled
binaries.

`-create-library` ::
    Create a library of compiled binaries specified in _input_programs_
    argument to {clLinkProgram}.

`-enable-link-options` ::
    Allows the linker to modify the library behavior based on one or more
    link options (described in <<program-linking-options, Program Linking
    Options>>) when this library is linked with a program executable.
    This option must be specified with the create-library option.


[[program-linking-options]]
==== Program Linking Options

The following options can be specified when linking a program executable.

`-cl-denorms-are-zero` +
`-cl-no-signed-zeros` +
`-cl-unsafe-math-optimizations` +
`-cl-finite-math-only` +
`-cl-fast-relaxed-math` +
`-cl-no-subgroup-ifp` (<<unified-spec, missing before>> version 2.1)

The options are described in <<math-intrinsics-options, Math Intrinsics
Options>> and <<optimization-options, Optimization Options>>.
The linker may apply these options to all compiled program objects
specified to {clLinkProgram}.
The linker may apply these options only to libraries which were created
with the option `-enable-link-options`.


ifdef::cl_khr_spir[]
[[spir-compilation-options]]
==== SPIR Compilation Options

If the {cl_khr_spir_EXT} extension is supported, the compile option

`-x spir`

must be specified to indicate that the binary is in SPIR format, and the
compile option

`-spir-std`

must be used to specify the version of the SPIR specification that describes
the format and meaning of the binary.

For example, if the binary is as described in SPIR version 1.2, then

`-spir-std=1.2`

must be specified.
Failing to specify these compile options may result in
implementation-defined behavior.
endif::cl_khr_spir[]


=== Unloading the OpenCL Compiler

[open,refpage='clUnloadPlatformCompiler',desc='Allows the implementation to release the resources allocated by the OpenCL compiler for a platform.',type='protos']
--
To unload an OpenCL compiler for a platform, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clUnloadPlatformCompiler.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clUnloadPlatformCompiler.asciidoc[]

  * _platform_ is the platform to unload.

This function allows the implementation to release the resources allocated
by the OpenCL compiler for _platform_.
This is a hint from the application and does not guarantee that the compiler
will not be used in the future or that the compiler will actually be
unloaded by the implementation.
Calls to {clBuildProgram}, {clCompileProgram} or {clLinkProgram} after
{clUnloadPlatformCompiler} will reload the compiler, if necessary, to build
the appropriate program executable.

// refError

{clUnloadPlatformCompiler} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_PLATFORM} if _platform_ is not a valid platform.
--

[open,refpage='clUnloadCompiler',desc='Allows the implementation to release the resources allocated by the OpenCL compiler.',type='protos']
--
Alternatively, if you are not using OpenCL via the ICD loader, you may unload the OpenCL compiler with the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clUnloadCompiler.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clUnloadCompiler.asciidoc[]

This function allows the implementation to release the resources allocated
by the OpenCL compiler.
This is a hint from the application and does not guarantee that the compiler
will not be used in the future or that the compiler will actually be
unloaded by the implementation.
Calls to {clBuildProgram}, {clCompileProgram} or {clLinkProgram} after
{clUnloadCompiler} will reload the compiler, if necessary, to build
the appropriate program executable.

// refError

{clUnloadCompiler} will always return {CL_SUCCESS}.

=== Program Object Queries

[open,refpage='clGetProgramInfo',desc='Returns information about the program object.',type='protos']
--
To return information about a program object, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clGetProgramInfo.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clGetProgramInfo.asciidoc[]

  * _program_ specifies the program object being queried.
  * _param_name_ specifies the information to query.
    The list of supported _param_name_ types and the information returned in
    _param_value_ by {clGetProgramInfo} is described in the
    <<program-info-table,Program Object Queries>> table.
  * _param_value_ is a pointer to memory where the appropriate result being
    queried is returned.
    If _param_value_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.
  * _param_value_size_ specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to by
    _param_value_.
    This size must be greater than or equal to the size of the return type
    specified in the <<program-info-table, Program Object Queries>> table.
    If _param_value_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.
  * _param_value_size_ret_ returns the actual size in bytes of data being
    queried by _param_name_.
    If _param_value_size_ret_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.

      | Returns an array that contains the size in bytes of the program
        binary (could be an executable binary, compiled binary or library
        binary) for each device associated with program.
        The size of the array is the number of devices associated with
        program.
        If a binary is not available for a device(s), a size of zero is
        returned.

        If _program_ is created using {clCreateProgramWithBuiltInKernels},
        the implementation may return zero in any entries of the returned
        array.
| {CL_PROGRAM_BINARIES_anchor}

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/CL_PROGRAM_BINARIES.asciidoc[]
  | {unsigned_char_TYPE}*[]
      | Return the program binaries (could be an executable binary, compiled
        binary or library binary) for all devices associated with program.
        For each device in program, the binary returned can be the binary
        specified for the device when program is created with
        {clCreateProgramWithBinary} or it can be the executable binary
        generated by {clBuildProgram} or {clLinkProgram}.
        If _program_ is created with {clCreateProgramWithSource} or
        {clCreateProgramWithIL}, the binary returned is the binary generated
        by {clBuildProgram}, {clCompileProgram} or {clLinkProgram}.
        The bits returned can be an implementation-specific intermediate
        representation (a.k.a. IR) or device specific executable bits or
        both.
        The decision on which information is returned in the binary is up to
        the OpenCL implementation.

        param_value points to an array of `n` pointers allocated by the
        caller, where `n` is the number of devices associated with program.
        The buffer sizes needed to allocate the memory that these `n`
        pointers refer to can be queried using the {CL_PROGRAM_BINARY_SIZES}
        query as described in this table.

        Each entry in this array is used by the implementation as the
        location in memory where to copy the program binary for a specific
        device, if there is a binary available.
        To find out which device the program binary in the array refers to,
        use the {CL_PROGRAM_DEVICES} query to get the list of devices.
        There is a one-to-one correspondence between the array of n pointers
        returned by {CL_PROGRAM_BINARIES} and array of devices returned by
        {CL_PROGRAM_DEVICES}.

== Kernel Objects

A kernel is a function declared in a program.
A kernel is identified by the `+__kernel+` qualifier applied to any function
in a program.
A kernel object encapsulates the specific `+__kernel+` function declared in
a program and the argument values to be used when executing this
`+__kernel+` function.


=== Creating Kernel Objects

[open,refpage='clCreateKernel',desc='Creates a kernel object.',type='protos']
--
To create a kernel object, use the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCreateKernel.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clCreateKernel.asciidoc[]

  * _program_ is a program object with a successfully built executable.
  * _kernel_name_ is a function name in the program declared with the
    `+__kernel+` qualifier.
  * _errcode_ret_ will return an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

// refError

{clCreateKernel} returns a valid non-zero kernel object and _errcode_ret_ is
set to {CL_SUCCESS} if the kernel object is created successfully.
Otherwise, it returns a `NULL` value with one of the following error values
returned in _errcode_ret_:

  * {CL_INVALID_PROGRAM} if _program_ is not a valid program object.
  * {CL_INVALID_PROGRAM_EXECUTABLE} if there is no successfully built
    executable for _program_.
  * {CL_INVALID_KERNEL_NAME} if _kernel_name_ is not found in _program_.
  * {CL_INVALID_KERNEL_DEFINITION} if the function definition for `+__kernel+`
    function given by _kernel_name_ such as the number of arguments, the
    argument types are not the same for all devices for which the _program_
    executable has been built.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _kernel_name_ is `NULL`.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

[open,refpage='clCreateKernelsInProgram',desc='Creates kernel objects for all kernel functions in a program object.',type='protos']
--
To create kernel objects for all kernel functions in a program,
call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCreateKernelsInProgram.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clCreateKernelsInProgram.asciidoc[]

  * _program_ is a program object with a successfully built executable.
  * _num_kernels_ is the size of memory pointed to by _kernels_ specified as the
    number of {cl_kernel_TYPE} entries.
  * _kernels_ is the buffer where the kernel objects for kernels in _program_
    will be returned.
    If _kernels_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.
    If _kernels_ is not `NULL`, _num_kernels_ must be greater than or equal to
    the number of kernels in _program_.
  * _num_kernels_ret_ is the number of kernels in _program_.
    If _num_kernels_ret_ is `NULL`, it is ignored.

Kernel objects are not created for any `+__kernel+` functions in _program_
that do not have the same function definition across all devices for which a
program executable has been successfully built.

Kernel objects can only be created once you have a program object with a
valid program source or binary loaded into the program object and the
program executable has been successfully built for one or more devices
associated with program.
No changes to the program executable are allowed while there are kernel
objects associated with a program object.
This means that calls to {clBuildProgram} and {clCompileProgram} return
{CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if there are kernel objects attached to a program
object.
The OpenCL context associated with _program_ will be the context associated
with _kernel_.
The list of devices associated with _program_ are the devices associated
with _kernel_.
Devices associated with a program object for which a valid program
executable has been built can be used to execute kernels declared in the
program object.

// refError

{clCreateKernelsInProgram} will return  {CL_SUCCESS} if the kernel objects were
successfully allocated.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_PROGRAM} if _program_ is not a valid program object.
  * {CL_INVALID_PROGRAM_EXECUTABLE} if there is no successfully built
    executable for any device in _program_.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _kernels_ is not `NULL` and _num_kernels_ is less
    than the number of kernels in _program_.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

[open,refpage='clRetainKernel',desc='Increments the kernel object reference count.',type='protos']
--
To retain a kernel object, call the function

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clRetainKernel.asciidoc[]

  * _kernel_ is the kernel object to be retained.

The _kernel_ reference count is incremented.

// refError

{clRetainKernel} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_KERNEL} if _kernel_ is not a valid kernel object.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

{clCreateKernel} or {clCreateKernelsInProgram} do an implicit retain.

[open,refpage='clReleaseKernel',desc='Decrements the kernel reference count.',type='protos']
--
To release a kernel object, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clReleaseKernel.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clReleaseKernel.asciidoc[]

  * _kernel_ is the kernel object to be released.

The _kernel_ reference count is decremented.

The kernel object is deleted once the number of instances that are retained
to _kernel_ become zero and the kernel object is no longer needed by any
enqueued commands that use _kernel_.
Using this function to release a reference that was not obtained by creating
the object or by calling {clRetainKernel} causes undefined behavior.

// refError

{clReleaseKernel} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_KERNEL} if _kernel_ is not a valid kernel object.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

[[setting-kernel-arguments]]
=== Setting Kernel Arguments

To execute a kernel, the kernel arguments must be set.

[open,refpage='clSetKernelArg',desc='Set the argument value for a specific argument of a kernel.',type='protos']
--
To set the argument value for a specific argument of a kernel, call the
function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clSetKernelArg.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clSetKernelArg.asciidoc[]

  * _kernel_ is a valid kernel object.
  * _arg_index_ is the argument index.
    Arguments to the kernel are referred by indices that go from 0 for the
    leftmost argument to _n_ - 1, where _n_ is the total number of arguments
    declared by a kernel (see below).
  * _arg_size_ specifies the size of the argument value.
    If the argument is a memory object, the _arg_size_ value must be equal to
    `sizeof({cl_mem_TYPE})`.
    For arguments declared with the `local` qualifier, the size specified will
    be the size in bytes of the buffer that must be allocated for the `local`
    argument.
    If the argument is of type _sampler_t_, the _arg_size_ value must be equal
    to `sizeof({cl_sampler_TYPE})`.
    If the argument is of type _queue_t_, the _arg_size_ value must be equal to
    `sizeof({cl_command_queue_TYPE})`.
    For all other arguments, the size will be the size of argument type.
  * _arg_value_ is a pointer to data that should be used as the argument value
    for argument specified by _arg_index_.
    The argument data pointed to by _arg_value_ is copied and the _arg_value_
    pointer can therefore be reused by the application after {clSetKernelArg}
    returns.
    The argument value specified is the value used by all API calls that enqueue
    _kernel_ ({clEnqueueNDRangeKernel} and {clEnqueueTask}) until the argument
    value is changed by a call to {clSetKernelArg} for _kernel_.

For example, consider the following kernel:

[source,opencl_c]
----
kernel void image_filter (int n,
                          int m,
                          constant float *filter_weights,
                          read_only image2d_t src_image,
                          write_only image2d_t dst_image)
{
...
}
----

Argument index values for `image_filter` will be 0 for `n`, 1 for `m`, 2 for
`filter_weights`, 3 for `src_image` and 4 for `dst_image`.

If the argument is a memory object (buffer, pipe, image or image array), the
_arg_value_ entry will be a pointer to the appropriate buffer, pipe, image
or image array object.
The memory object must be created with the context associated with the
kernel object.
If the argument is a buffer object, the _arg_value_ pointer can be `NULL` or
point to a `NULL` value in which case a `NULL` value will be used as the
value for the argument declared as a pointer to `global` or `constant`
memory in the kernel.
If the argument is declared with the `local` qualifier, the _arg_value_
entry must be `NULL`.
If the argument is of type _sampler_t_, the _arg_value_ entry must be a
pointer to the sampler object.
If the argument is of type _queue_t_, the _arg_value_ entry must be a
pointer to the device queue object.

ifdef::cl_khr_gl_msaa_sharing[]
If the {cl_khr_gl_msaa_sharing_EXT} extension is supported, then:
If the argument is a multi-sample 2D image, the _arg_value_ entry must be a
pointer to a multi-sample image object.
If the argument is a multi-sample 2D depth image, the _arg_value_ entry must
be a pointer to a multisample depth image object.
If the argument is a multi-sample 2D image array, the _arg_value_ entry must
be a pointer to a multi-sample image array object.
If the argument is a multi-sample 2D depth image array, the _arg_value_
entry must be a pointer to a multi-sample depth image array object.
endif::cl_khr_gl_msaa_sharing[]

If the argument is declared to be a pointer of a built-in scalar or vector
type, or a user defined structure type in the global or constant address
space, the memory object specified as argument value must be a buffer object
(or `NULL`).
If the argument is declared with the `constant` qualifier, the size in bytes
of the memory object cannot exceed {CL_DEVICE_MAX_CONSTANT_BUFFER_SIZE} and
the number of arguments declared as pointers to `constant` memory cannot
exceed {CL_DEVICE_MAX_CONSTANT_ARGS}.

The memory object specified as argument value must be a pipe object if the
argument is declared with the _pipe_ qualifier.

The memory object specified as argument value must be a 2D image object if
the argument is declared to be of type _image2d_t_.
The memory object specified as argument value must be a 2D image object with
image channel order = {CL_DEPTH} if the argument is declared to be of type
_image2d_depth_t_.
The memory object specified as argument value must be a 3D image object if
argument is declared to be of type _image3d_t_.
The memory object specified as argument value must be a 1D image object if
the argument is declared to be of type _image1d_t_.
The memory object specified as argument value must be a 1D image buffer
object if the argument is declared to be of type _image1d_buffer_t_.
The memory object specified as argument value must be a 1D image array
object if argument is declared to be of type _image1d_array_t_.
The memory object specified as argument value must be a 2D image array
object if argument is declared to be of type _image2d_array_t_.
The memory object specified as argument value must be a 2D image array
object with image channel order = {CL_DEPTH} if argument is declared to be of
type _image2d_array_depth_t_.

For all other kernel arguments, the _arg_value_ entry must be a pointer to
the actual data to be used as argument value.

[NOTE]
====
A kernel object does not update the reference count for objects such as
memory or sampler objects specified as argument values by {clSetKernelArg}.
Users may not rely on a kernel object to retain objects specified as
argument values to the kernel.

Implementations shall not allow {cl_kernel_TYPE} objects to hold reference
counts to {cl_kernel_TYPE} arguments, because no mechanism is provided for the
user to tell the kernel to release that ownership right.
If the kernel holds ownership rights on kernel args, that would make it
impossible for users to tell with certainty when they may safely
release user allocated resources associated with OpenCL objects such as
the {cl_mem_TYPE} backing store used with {CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR}.

=== Copying Kernel Objects

NOTE: Copying kernel objects is <<unified-spec, missing before>> version 2.1.

[open,refpage='clCloneKernel',desc='Make a shallow copy of the kernel object.',type='protos']
--
To clone a kernel object, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCloneKernel.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clCloneKernel.asciidoc[]

  * _source_kernel_ is a valid {cl_kernel_TYPE} object that will be copied.
    _source_kernel_ will not be modified in any way by this function.
  * _errcode_ret_ will be assigned an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

Cloning is used to make a shallow copy of the kernel object, its arguments
and any information passed to the kernel object using {clSetKernelExecInfo}.
If the kernel object was ready to be enqueued before copying it, the clone
of the kernel object is ready to enqueue.

The returned kernel object is an exact copy of _source_kernel_, with one
caveat: the reference count on the returned kernel object is set as if it
had been returned by {clCreateKernel}.
The reference count of _source_kernel will_ not be changed.

The resulting kernel will be in the same state as if {clCreateKernel} is
called to create the resultant kernel with the same arguments as those used
to create _source_kernel_, the latest call to {clSetKernelArg} or
{clSetKernelArgSVMPointer} for each argument index applied to kernel and the
last call to {clSetKernelExecInfo} for each value of the param name
parameter are applied to the new kernel object.

All arguments of the new kernel object must be intact and it may be
correctly used in the same situations as kernel except those that assume a
pre-existing reference count.
Setting arguments on the new kernel object will not affect _source_kernel_
except insofar as the argument points to a shared underlying entity and in
that situation behavior is as if two kernel objects had been created and the
same argument applied to each.
Only the data stored in the kernel object is copied; data referenced by the
kernels arguments are not copied.
For example, if a buffer or pointer argument is set on a kernel object, the
pointer is copied but the underlying memory allocation is not.

// refError

{clCloneKernel} returns a valid non-zero kernel object and _errcode_ret_ is
set to  {CL_SUCCESS} if the kernel is successfully copied.
Otherwise it returns a `NULL` value with one of the following error values
returned in _errcode_ret_:

  * {CL_INVALID_KERNEL} if _kernel_ is not a valid kernel object.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources

            execute a kernel on a specific device given by device.
            The OpenCL implementation uses the resource requirements of the
            kernel (register usage etc.) to determine what this work-group
            size should be.
            The returned value may be used to compute a work-group size to

To enqueue a command to execute a kernel on a device, call the function

include::{generated}/api/protos/clEnqueueNDRangeKernel.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clEnqueueNDRangeKernel.asciidoc[]

  * _command_queue_ is a valid host command-queue.
    The kernel will be queued for execution on the device associated with
    _command_queue_.
  * _kernel_ is a valid kernel object.
    The OpenCL context associated with _kernel_ and _command-queue_ must be the
    same.
  * _work_dim_ is the number of dimensions used to specify the global work-items
    and work-items in the work-group.
    _work_dim_ must be greater than zero and less than or equal to
    {CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_ITEM_DIMENSIONS}.
    If _global_work_size_ is `NULL`, or the value in any passed dimension is 0
    then the kernel command will trivially succeed after its event dependencies
    are satisfied and subsequently update its completion event.
    The behavior in this situation is similar to that of an enqueued marker,
    except that unlike a marker, an enqueued kernel with no events passed to
    _event_wait_list_ may run at any time.
  * _global_work_offset_ can be used to specify an array of _work_dim_ unsigned
    values that describe the offset used to calculate the global ID of a
    work-item.
    If _global_work_offset_ is `NULL`, the global IDs start at offset (0, 0, 0).
    _global_work_offset_ must be `NULL` <<unified-spec, before>> version 1.1.
  * _global_work_size_ points to an array of _work_dim_ unsigned values that
    describe the number of global work-items in _work_dim_ dimensions that will
    execute the kernel function.
    The total number of global work-items is computed as _global_work_size_[0]
    {times} ... {times} _global_work_size_[_work_dim_ - 1].
  * _local_work_size_ points to an array of _work_dim_ unsigned values that
    describe the number of work-items that make up a work-group (also referred
    to as the size of the work-group) that will execute the kernel specified by
    _kernel_.
    The total number of work-items in a work-group is computed as
    _local_work_size_[0] {times} ... {times} _local_work_size_[_work_dim_ - 1].
    The total number of work-items in the work-group must be less than or equal
    to the {CL_KERNEL_WORK_GROUP_SIZE} value specified in the
    <<kernel-workgroup-info-table,Kernel Object Device Queries>> table, and the
    number of work-items specified in _local_work_size_[0], ...,
    _local_work_size_[_work_dim_ - 1] must be less than or equal to the
    corresponding values specified by {CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_ITEM_SIZES}[0], ...,
    {CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_ITEM_SIZES}[_work_dim_ - 1].
    The explicitly specified _local_work_size_ will be used to determine how to
    break the global work-items specified by _global_work_size_ into appropriate
    work-group instances.
  * _event_wait_list_ and _num_events_in_wait_list_ specify events that need to
    complete before this particular command can be executed.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then this particular command does not wait
    on any event to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
    If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0.
    The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as synchronization points.
    The context associated with events in _event_wait_list_ and _command_queue_
    must be the same.
    The memory associated with _event_wait_list_ can be reused or freed after
    the function returns.
  * _event_ returns an event object that identifies this command and
    can be used to query or wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_ is `NULL` or the enqueue is unsuccessful, no event will be
    created and therefore it will not be possible to query the status of this
    command or to wait for this command to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ and _event_ are not `NULL`, _event_ must not refer
    to an element of the _event_wait_list_ array.

An ND-range kernel command may require uniform work-groups or may support non-uniform work-groups.
To support non-uniform work-groups:

. The device associated with _command_queue_ must support non-uniform work-groups.
. The program object associated with _kernel_ must support non-uniform work-groups.
Specifically, this means:
.. If the program was created with {clCreateProgramWithSource}, the program must be compiled or built using the `-cl-std=CL2.0` or `-cl-std=CL3.0` build option and without the `-cl-uniform-work-group-size` build option.
.. If the program was created with {clCreateProgramWithIL} or {clCreateProgramWithBinary}, the program must be compiled or built without the `-cl-uniform-work-group-size` build options.
.. If the program was created using {clLinkProgram}, all input programs must support non-uniform work-groups.

If non-uniform work-groups are supported, any single dimension
for which the global size is not divisible by the local size will be
partitioned into two regions.
One region will have work-groups that have the same number of work-items as
was specified by the local size parameter in that dimension.
The other region will have work-groups with less than the number of work
items specified by the local size parameter in that dimension.
The global IDs and group IDs of the work-items in the first region will be
numerically lower than those in the second, and the second region will be at
most one work-group wide in that dimension.
Work-group sizes could be non-uniform in multiple dimensions, potentially
producing work-groups of up to 4 different sizes in a 2D range and 8
different sizes in a 3D range.

If non-uniform work-groups are supported and _local_work_size_ is `NULL`, the OpenCL runtime may choose a uniform or non-uniform work-group size.

Otherwise, when non-uniform work-groups are not supported, the size of each work-group must be uniform.
If _local_work_size_ is specified, the values specified in _global_work_size_[0], ..., _global_work_size_[_work_dim_ - 1] must be evenly divisible by the corresponding values specified in _local_work_size_[0], ..., _local_work_size_[_work_dim_ - 1].
If _local_work_size_ is `NULL`, the OpenCL runtime must choose a uniform work-group size.

The work-group size to be used for _kernel_ can also be specified in the
program source or intermediate language.
In this case the size of work-group specified by _local_work_size_ must
match the value specified in the program source.

These work-group instances are executed in parallel across multiple compute
units or concurrently on the same compute unit.

Each work-item is uniquely identified by a global identifier.
The global ID, which can be read inside the kernel, is computed using the
value given by _global_work_size_ and _global_work_offset_.
In addition, a work-item is also identified within a work-group by a unique
local ID.
The local ID, which can also be read by the kernel, is computed using the
value given by _local_work_size_.
The starting local ID is always (0, 0, ..., 0).

[[event-objects]]
== Event Objects

An event object can be used to track the execution status of a command.
The API calls that enqueue commands to a command-queue create a new event
object that is returned in the _event_ argument.
In case of an error enqueuing the command in the command-queue the event
argument does not return an event object.

The execution status of an enqueued command at any given point in time can
be one of the following:

  * {CL_QUEUED_anchor}: Indicates that the command has been enqueued in a
    command-queue.
    This is the initial state of all events except user events.
  * {CL_SUBMITTED_anchor}: The initial state for all user events.
    For all other events, indicates that the command has been submitted
    by the host to the device.
  * {CL_RUNNING_anchor}: Indicates that the device has started executing this
    command.
    In order for the execution status of an enqueued command to change from
    {CL_SUBMITTED} to {CL_RUNNING}, all events that this command is waiting on
    must have completed successfully i.e. their execution status must be
    {CL_COMPLETE}.
  * {CL_COMPLETE_anchor}: Indicates that the command has successfully completed.
  * An Error Code: A negative integer value indicating that the command was
    abnormally terminated. Abnormal termination may occur for a number of reasons,
    such as a bad memory access.

[NOTE]
====
A command is considered to be complete if its execution status is
{CL_COMPLETE} or is a negative integer value.

If the execution of a command is terminated, the command-queue associated
with this terminated command, and the associated context (and all other
command-queues in this context) may no longer be available.
The behavior of OpenCL API calls that use this context (and command-queues
associated with this context) are now considered to be
implementation-defined.
The user registered callback function specified when context is created can
be used to report appropriate error information.

include::{generated}/api/protos/clCreateUserEvent.txt[]

  * _context_ must be a valid OpenCL context.
  * _errcode_ret_ will return an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

User events allow applications to enqueue commands that wait on a user event
to finish before the command is executed by the device.

// refError

{clCreateUserEvent} returns a valid non-zero event object and _errcode_ret_
is set to {CL_SUCCESS} if the user event object is created successfully.
Otherwise, it returns a `NULL` value with one of the following error values
returned in _errcode_ret_:

  * {CL_INVALID_CONTEXT} if _context_ is not a valid context.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required
    by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

The initial execution status for the user event object is {CL_SUBMITTED}.

include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clSetUserEventStatus.asciidoc[]

  * _event_ is a user event object created using {clCreateUserEvent}.
  * _execution_status_ specifies the new execution status to be set and can be
    {CL_COMPLETE} or a negative integer value to indicate an error.
    A negative integer value causes all enqueued commands that wait on this user
    event to be terminated.
    {clSetUserEventStatus} can only be called once to change the execution
    status of _event_.

[NOTE]
====
If there are enqueued commands with user events in the _event_wait_list_
argument of *+clEnqueue*+* commands, the user must ensure that the status of
these user events being waited on are set using {clSetUserEventStatus}
before any OpenCL APIs that release OpenCL objects except for event objects
are called; otherwise the behavior is undefined.

For example, the following code sequence will result in undefined behavior
of {clReleaseMemObject}.

[source,opencl]
----
ev1 = clCreateUserEvent(ctx, NULL);
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(cq, buf1, CL_FALSE, ..., 1, &ev1, NULL);
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(cq, buf2, CL_FALSE, ...);
clReleaseMemObject(buf2);
clSetUserEventStatus(ev1, CL_COMPLETE);
----

The following code sequence, however, works correctly.

[source,opencl]
----
ev1 = clCreateUserEvent(ctx, NULL);
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(cq, buf1, CL_FALSE, ..., 1, &ev1, NULL);
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(cq, buf2, CL_FALSE, ...);

Using {clGetEventInfo} to determine if a command identified by _event_ has
finished execution (i.e. {CL_EVENT_COMMAND_EXECUTION_STATUS} returns
{CL_COMPLETE}) is not a synchronization point.
There are no guarantees that the memory objects being modified by command
associated with _event_ will be visible to other enqueued commands.

// refError

{clGetEventInfo} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if the function is executed
successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

  * {CL_INVALID_EVENT} if _event_ is a not a valid event object.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _param_name_ is not one of the supported values, or
    if the size in bytes specified by _param_value_size_ is less than size of
    the return type specified in the
    <<event-info-table,Event Object Queries>> table
    and _param_value_ is not `NULL`.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if the information to query given in _param_name_ cannot be
    queried for _event_.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES} if there is a failure to allocate resources required

include::{generated}/api/protos/clSetEventCallback.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clSetEventCallback.asciidoc[]

  * _event_ is a valid event object.
  * _command_exec_callback_type_ specifies the command execution status for
    which the callback is registered.
    The command execution status types for which a callback can be registered
    are {CL_SUBMITTED}, {CL_RUNNING}, or {CL_COMPLETE}.
    The callback function registered for a _command_exec_callback_type_ value of
    {CL_COMPLETE} will be called when the command has completed successfully or
    is abnormally terminated.
  * _pfn_event_notify_ is the event callback function that can be registered by
    the application.
    This callback function may be called asynchronously by the OpenCL
    implementation.
    It is the application's responsibility to ensure that the callback function
    is thread-safe.
    The parameters to this callback function are:
  ** _event_ is the event object for which the callback function is invoked.
  ** _event_command_status_ is equal to the _command_exec_callback_type_
     used while registering the callback.
     Refer to the <<event-info-table,Event Object Queries>>
     table for the command execution status values.
     If the callback is called as the result of the command associated with
     event being abnormally terminated, an appropriate error code for the
     error that caused the termination will be passed to
     _event_command_status_ instead.
  ** _user_data_ is a pointer to user supplied data.
  * _user_data_ will be passed as the _user_data_ argument when _pfn_notify_ is
    called.
    _user_data_ can be `NULL`.

Each call to {clSetEventCallback} registers the specified user callback
function on a callback stack associated with _event_.
The order in which the registered user callback functions are called is
undefined.

The registered callback function will be called when the execution status of the
command associated with _event_ changes to an execution status equal to or past
the status specified by _command_exec_status_, or for the execution status
{CL_COMPLETE}, if the command is abnormally terminated.
There is no guarantee that the callback functions registered for various command
execution status values for an event will be called in the exact order that the
execution status of a command changes.
Furthermore, it should be noted that calling a callback for an event execution
status other than {CL_COMPLETE} in no way implies that the memory model or
execution model as defined by the OpenCL specification has changed. For example,
it is not valid to assume that a corresponding memory transfer has completed
unless the event is in the state {CL_COMPLETE}.

All callbacks registered for an event object must be called before the event
object is destroyed.

Callbacks should return promptly.
Behavior is undefined when calling expensive system routines, OpenCL APIs to
create contexts or command-queues, or blocking OpenCL APIs in an event callback.
Rather than calling a blocking OpenCL API in an event callback, applications
may call a non-blocking OpenCL API, then register a completion callback
for the non-blocking OpenCL API with the remainder of the work.

Because commands in a command-queue are not required to begin execution
until the command-queue is flushed, callbacks that enqueue commands on a
command-queue should either call {clFlush} on the queue before returning,
or arrange for the command-queue to be flushed later.

// refError

The event object is deleted once the reference count becomes zero, the
specific command identified by this event has completed (or terminated) and
there are no commands in the command-queues of a context that require a wait
for this event to complete.
Using this function to release a reference that was not obtained by creating
the object or by calling {clRetainEvent} causes undefined behavior.

[NOTE]
====
Developers should be careful when releasing their last reference count on
events created by {clCreateUserEvent} that have not yet been set to status
of {CL_COMPLETE} or an error.
If the user event was used in the event_wait_list argument passed to a
*+clEnqueue*+* API or another application host thread is waiting for it in
{clWaitForEvents}, those commands and host threads will continue to wait for
the event status to reach {CL_COMPLETE} or error, even after the application
has released the object.
Since in this scenario the application has released its last reference count
to the user event, it would be in principle no longer valid for the
application to change the status of the event to unblock all the other
machinery.
As a result the waiting tasks will wait forever, and associated events,
{cl_mem_TYPE} objects, command-queues and contexts are likely to leak.
In-order command-queues caught up in this deadlock may cease to do any work.

  * _display_ is the `EGLDisplay` handle.
  * _errcode_ret_ will return an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

Completion of such an event object is equivalent to waiting for completion
of the fence command associated with the linked EGL sync object.

The parameters of an event object linked to an EGL sync object will return
the following values when queried with {clGetEventInfo}:

  * The {CL_EVENT_COMMAND_QUEUE} of a linked event is `NULL`, because the
    event is not associated with any OpenCL command-queue.
  * The {CL_EVENT_COMMAND_TYPE} of a linked event is
    {CL_COMMAND_EGL_FENCE_SYNC_OBJECT_KHR}, indicating that the event is

    {CL_SUBMITTED}, indicating that the fence command associated with the
    sync object has not yet completed, or {CL_COMPLETE}, indicating that the
    fence command has completed.

{clCreateEventFromEGLSyncKHR} performs an implicit {clRetainEvent} on the
returned event object.
Creating a linked event object also places a reference on the linked EGL
sync object.
When the event object is deleted, the reference will be removed from the EGL
sync object.

Events returned from {clCreateEventFromEGLSyncKHR} may only be consumed by

===== Explicit Synchronization Using EGL Fence Sync Objects

If the {cl_khr_egl_event_EXT} extension is supported, event objects created
with {clCreateEventFromEGLsyncKHR} provide another method of coordinating
sharing between EGL / EGL client API objects, and OpenCL.

Completion of EGL and EGL client API commands may be determined by

  * placing an EGL fence command after commands using `eglCreateSyncKHR`;
  * creating an event from the resulting EGL sync object using
    {clCreateEventFromEGLSyncKHR}; and
  * determining completion of that event object via
    {clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects}.

This method may be considerably more efficient than calling operations like
`glFinish`, and is referred to as _explicit synchronization_.
The application is responsible for ensuring the command stream associated
with the EGL fence is flushed to ensure the CL queue is submitted to the
device.
Explicit synchronization is most useful when an EGL client API context bound
to another thread is accessing the memory objects.

=== Importing Semaphore External Handles

Applications can import a semaphore payload by creating a semaphore from an external handle. The
implementation must perform the import operation by either referencing or copying the payload
referred to by the specified external semaphore handle, depending on the handle's type. When using
handle types with reference transference, importing a payload to a semaphore adds the semaphore to
the set of all semaphores sharing that payload. This set includes the semaphore from which the payload
was exported. Semaphore signaling and waiting operations performed on any semaphore in the set must
behave as if the set were a single semaphore. Importing a payload using handle types with copy
transference creates a duplicate copy of the payload at the time of import, but makes no further
reference to it. Semaphore signaling and waiting operations performed on the target of copy imports
must not affect any other semaphore or payload.

Please refer to handle specific documentation for more details on transference requirements per
handle type.


[[external-semaphore-handle-types]]
=== Descriptions of External Semaphore Handle Types

This section describes the external semaphore handle types that are added by
related extensions.

Applications can import the same semaphore payload into multiple OpenCL
contexts, into the same context from which it was exported, and multiple
times into a given OpenCL context.
In all cases, each import operation must create a distinct semaphore object.

==== File Descriptor Handle Types

ifdef::cl_khr_external_semaphore_opaque_fd[]

The {cl_khr_external_semaphore_opaque_fd_EXT} extension extends
{cl_external_semaphore_handle_type_khr_TYPE} to support the following new
types of handles, and adds as a property that may be specified when creating
a semaphore from an external handle:

  * {CL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_OPAQUE_FD_KHR} specifies a POSIX file descriptor
    handle that has only limited valid usage outside of OpenCL and other
    compatible APIs.
    It must be compatible with the POSIX system calls `dup`, `dup2`,
    `close`, and the non-standard system call `dup3`.
    Additionally, it must be transportable over a socket using an
    `SCM_RIGHTS` control message.
    It owns a reference to the underlying synchronization primitive
    represented by its semaphore object.

endif::cl_khr_external_semaphore_opaque_fd[]

ifdef::cl_khr_external_semaphore_sync_fd[]

The {cl_khr_external_semaphore_sync_fd_EXT} extension extends
{cl_external_semaphore_handle_type_khr_TYPE} to support the following new
types of handles, and adds as a property that may be specified when creating
a semaphore from an external handle:

  * {CL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_SYNC_FD_KHR} specifies a POSIX file descriptor
    handle to a Linux Sync File or Android Fence object.
    It can be used with any native API accepting a valid sync file or fence
    as input.
    It owns a reference to the underlying synchronization primitive
    associated with the file descriptor.
    Implementations which support importing this handle type must accept any
    type of sync or fence FD supported by the native system they are running
    on.

The special value -1 for fd is treated like a valid sync file descriptor
referring to an object that has already signaled.
The import operation will succeed and the semaphore will have a temporarily
imported payload as if a valid file descriptor had been provided.

Note: This special behavior for importing an invalid sync file descriptor
allows easier interoperability with other system APIs which use the
convention that an invalid sync file descriptor represents work that has
already completed and does not need to be waited for.
It is consistent with the option for implementations to return a -1 file
descriptor when exporting a {CL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_SYNC_FD_KHR} from a
{cl_semaphore_khr_TYPE} which is signaled.

  * _fd_ specifies an external file descriptor handle to import

Calling {clReImportSemaphoreSyncFdKHR} is equivalent to destroying
_sema_object_ and re-creating it with the original _sema_props_ from
{clCreateSemaphoreWithPropertiesKHR}, except a handle specified by _fd_ will
be imported.

    It must be compatible with the functions `DuplicateHandle`,
    `CloseHandle`, `CompareObjectHandles`, `GetHandleInformation`, and
    `SetHandleInformation`.
    It owns a reference to the underlying synchronization primitive
    represented by its semaphore object.
  * {CL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_OPAQUE_WIN32_KMT_KHR} specifies a global share
    handle that has only limited valid usage outside of OpenCL and other
    compatible APIs.
    It is not compatible with any native APIs.
    It does not own a reference to the underlying synchronization primitive
    represented by its semaphore object, and will therefore become invalid
    when all semaphore objects associated with it are destroyed.
  * {CL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_OPAQUE_WIN32_NAME_KHR} specifies an NT handle name that has
    only limited valid usage outside of OpenCL and other compatible APIs.
    NT handle name is a null-terminated UTF-16 string naming the payload to import.
    It must be compatible with the functions `DuplicateHandle`,
    `CloseHandle`, `CompareObjectHandles`, `GetHandleInformation`, and
    `SetHandleInformation`.

    represented by its semaphore object.

include::{generated}/api/protos/clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR.txt[]
include::{generated}/api/version-notes/clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR.asciidoc[]

  * _command_queue_ specifies a valid command-queue.
  * _num_sema_objects_ specifies the number of semaphore objects to wait on.
  * _sema_objects_ points to the list of semaphore objects to wait on.
    The length of the list must be at least _num_sema_objects_.
  * _sema_payload_list_ points to the list of values of type
    {cl_semaphore_payload_khr_TYPE} containing valid semaphore payload
    values to wait on.
    This can be set to `NULL` or will be ignored when all semaphores in the
    list of _sema_objects_ are of type {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY_KHR}.
  * _num_events_in_wait_list_ specifies the number of events in
    _event_wait_list_.
  * _event_wait_list_ specifies list of events that need to complete before
    {clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} can be executed.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then {clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} does
    not wait on any event to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
    If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0.
    The events specified in _event_wait_list_ act as synchronization points.
    The context associated with events in _event_wait_list_ and that
    associated with _command_queue_ must be the same.
  * _event_ returns an event object that identifies this particular command
    and can be used to query or queue a wait for this particular command to
    complete.
    _event_ can be `NULL`, in which case it will not be possible for the
    application to query the status of this command or queue a wait for this
    command to complete.

The semaphore wait command waits for a list of events to complete and a list
of semaphore objects to become signaled.
The semaphore wait command returns an _event_ which can be waited on to
ensure that all events in the _event_wait_list_ have completed and all
semaphores in _sema_objects_ have been signaled.
{clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} will not return until the binary semaphores in
_sema_objects_ are in a state that makes them safe to re-signal.
If necessary, implementations may block in {clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} to
ensure the correct state of semaphores when returning.
There are no implications from this behavior for the state of _event_ or the
events in _event_wait_list_ when {clEnqueueWaitSemaphoresKHR} returns.
Waiting on the same binary semaphore twice without an interleaving signal
may lead to undefined behavior.

[NOTE]
====
When _command_queue_ is an out-of-order command-queue there are no implicit
dependencies between the semaphore wait command and commands enqueued into the
command-queue after the semaphore wait command.
If such dependencies are required, applications may enqueue a command-queue
barrier after the semaphore wait command, to explicitly add dependencies between
the semaphore wait command and subsequent commands.

  * _command_queue_ specifies a valid command-queue.
  * _num_sema_objects_ specifies the number of semaphore objects to signal.

    The length of the list must be at least _num_sema_objects_.
  * _sema_payload_list_ points to the list of values of type
    {cl_semaphore_payload_khr_TYPE} containing semaphore payload values to
    signal.
    This can be set to `NULL` or will be ignored when all semaphores in the
    list of _sema_objects_ are of type {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY_KHR}.
  * _num_events_in_wait_list_ specifies the number of events in

    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, then {clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} does
    not wait on any event to complete.
    If _event_wait_list_ is `NULL`, _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be 0.
    If _event_wait_list_ is not `NULL`, the list of events pointed to by
    _event_wait_list_ must be valid and _num_events_in_wait_list_ must be
    greater than 0.

_event_ returns an event object that identifies this particular command
and can be used to query or queue a wait for this particular command to
complete.
_event_ can be `NULL`, in which case it will not be possible for the
application to query the status of this command or queue a wait for this
command to complete.

The semaphore signal command waits for a list of events to complete and then
signals a list of semaphore objects.
The semaphore signal command returns an _event_ which can be waited on to
ensure that all events in the _event_wait_list_ have completed and all
semaphores in _sema_objects_ have been signaled.
The successful completion of the event generated by
{clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} called on one or more semaphore objects of
type {CL_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY_KHR} changes the state of the corresponding
semaphore objects to signaled.
{clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} will not return until the binary semaphores
in _sema_objects_ are in a state that makes them safe to wait on again.
If necessary, implementations may block in {clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} to
ensure the correct state of semaphores when returning.
There are no implications from this behavior for the state of _event_ or the
events in _event_wait_list_ when {clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR} returns.
Signaling the same binary semaphore twice without an interleaving wait may
lead to undefined behavior.

[NOTE]
====
When _command_queue_ is an out-of-order command-queue there are no implicit
dependencies between commands enqueued into the command-queue before the
semaphore signal command and the semaphore signal command.
If such dependencies are required, applications may enqueue a command-queue
barrier before the semaphore signal command, to explicitly add dependencies between
the preceding commands and the semaphore signal command.

== Out-of-Order Execution of Kernels and Memory Object Commands

The OpenCL functions that are submitted to a command-queue are enqueued in
the order the calls are made but can be configured to execute in-order or
out-of-order.
The _properties_ argument in {clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties} or
{clCreateCommandQueue} can be used to specify the execution order.

If the {CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE} property of a command-queue is
not set, the commands enqueued to a command-queue execute in-order.
For example, if an application calls {clEnqueueNDRangeKernel} to execute
kernel A followed by a {clEnqueueNDRangeKernel} to execute kernel B, the
application can assume that kernel A finishes first and then kernel B is
executed.
If the memory objects output by kernel A are inputs to kernel B then kernel
B will see the correct data in memory objects produced by execution of
kernel A.
If the {CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE} property of a command-queue is
set, then there is no guarantee that kernel A will finish before kernel B
starts execution.

Applications can configure the commands enqueued to a command-queue to
execute out-of-order by setting the {CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE}
property of the command-queue.
This can be specified when the command-queue is created.
In out-of-order execution mode there is no guarantee that the enqueued
commands will finish execution in the order they were queued.
As there is no guarantee that kernels will be executed in-order, i.e. based
on when the {clEnqueueNDRangeKernel} or {clEnqueueTask} calls are made within a
command-queue, it is therefore possible that an earlier
{clEnqueueNDRangeKernel} call to execute kernel A identified by event A may
execute and/or finish later than a {clEnqueueNDRangeKernel} call to execute
kernel B which was called by the application at a later point in time.
To guarantee a specific order of execution of kernels, a wait on a
particular event (in this case event A) can be used.
The wait for event A can be specified in the _event_wait_list_ argument to
{clEnqueueNDRangeKernel} for kernel B.

In addition, a marker ({clEnqueueMarker} or {clEnqueueMarkerWithWaitList}) or a
barrier ({clEnqueueBarrier} or {clEnqueueBarrierWithWaitList}) command can be
enqueued to the command-queue.
The marker command ensures that previously enqueued commands identified by
the list of events to wait for (or all previous commands) have finished.
A barrier command is similar to a marker command, but additionally
guarantees that no later-enqueued commands will execute until the waited-for
commands have executed.

Similarly, commands to read, write, copy or map memory objects that are
enqueued after {clEnqueueNDRangeKernel}, {clEnqueueTask} or
{clEnqueueNativeKernel} commands are not guaranteed to wait for kernels
scheduled for execution to have completed (if the
{CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE} property is set).
To ensure correct ordering of commands, the event object returned by
{clEnqueueNDRangeKernel}, {clEnqueueTask} or {clEnqueueNativeKernel} can be
used to enqueue a wait for event or a barrier command can be enqueued that must
complete before reads or writes to the memory object(s) occur.


[[profiling-operations]]
== Profiling Operations on Memory Objects and Kernels

This section describes the profiling of OpenCL functions that are enqueued
as commands to a command-queue. Profiling of OpenCL commands can be enabled
by using a command-queue created with the {CL_QUEUE_PROFILING_ENABLE}
flag set in the {CL_QUEUE_PROPERTIES} bitfield in the _properties_ argument to
{clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties}, or in the _properties_ argument to
{clCreateCommandQueue}.
When profiling is enabled, the event objects that are created from
enqueuing a command store a timestamp for each of their state transitions.

== Command-Buffers

A _command-buffer_ object represents a series of operations to be enqueued
on one or more command-queues without any application code interaction.
Grouping the operations together allows efficient enqueuing of repetitive
operations, as well as enabling driver optimizations.

Command-buffers are _sequential use_ by default, but may also be set to
_simultaneous use_ on creation if the device optionally supports this
capability.
A sequential use command-buffer must have a <<pending_count, Pending Count>>
of 0 or 1.
The simultaneous use capability removes this restriction and allows
command-buffers to have a <<pending_count, Pending Count>> greater than 1.

Command-buffers are created using an ordered list of command-queues that
commands are recorded to and execute on by default. All these queue objects
must share the same context, but may be associated with different devices when
the {cl_khr_command_buffer_multi_device_EXT} extension is supported.

When constructing a command-buffer by appending commands, the queue parameter
passed for the command being created is used to set the device with which the
command will be associated with, and also inform the scheduling of the command.
If the queue is an in-order queue, then an additional dependency is created on the
last command appended to the command-buffer using the same queue parameter. If
the queue is an out-of-order queue, then no extra dependencies on previous
commands using the same queue are created. All queue properties other than
{CL_QUEUE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EXEC_MODE_ENABLE} are ignored for the purposes of command
creation, with the exception of any vendor extension defined queue properties
that explicitly define semantics for this purpose.

When enqueuing a command-buffer, a list of command-queues to execute the
command-buffer on can be passed by the user, otherwise the command-queues set
on command-buffer creation are used by default for execution. A user passed
list may contain different command-queues, provided for each element the
substitute command-queue matches the device and context of the command-queue
used on command-buffer creation. Each command-queue in the enqueue list must
also have the minimum properties defined by
{CL_DEVICE_COMMAND_BUFFER_REQUIRED_QUEUE_PROPERTIES_KHR} and no properties
which are not reported by
{CL_DEVICE_COMMAND_BUFFER_SUPPORTED_QUEUE_PROPERTIES_KHR}. These queue
properties have the same execution semantics for {clEnqueueCommandBufferKHR}
as other operations enqueued to the queue.

While constructing a command-buffer it is valid for the user to interleave
calls to the same queue which create commands, such as
{clCommandNDRangeKernelKHR}, with queue submission calls, such as
{clEnqueueNDRangeKernel} or {clEnqueueCommandBufferKHR}.
That is, there is no effect on queue state from recording commands.
The purpose of the queue parameter is to define the device and properties of
the command, which are constant queries on the queue object.

A command-buffer object should increment the reference count of attached
OpenCL objects such as queues, buffers, images, and kernels referenced in
commands recorded to the command-buffer.
This enables correct behavior of the command-buffer when its attached
objects have been released.
On destruction of the command-buffer it should decrement these reference
counts, allowing the attached objects to be freed if appropriate.

[[command-buffer-kernel-argument-ref-counting]]
[NOTE]
====
A command-buffer object does not update the reference count of objects set
as arguments on kernels recorded into the command-buffer.
This is consistent with the reference counting behavior of {clSetKernelArg}.

Applications should ensure that objects passed as arguments to kernels
recorded to a command-buffer are not deleted until the command-buffer has
been released.
Undefined behavior may result from the failure to follow this usage
requirement for all the command-buffers an object is used as a kernel
argument in.

usage>>.

=== Command-Buffers and Multiple Devices

If the {cl_khr_command_buffer_multi_device_EXT} extension is supported, a
command-buffer can contain commands recorded to the queues of different
devices if a vendor provides support for inter-device
{cl_sync_point_khr_TYPE} synchronization.
This feature is reported either through
{CL_DEVICE_COMMAND_BUFFER_SYNC_DEVICES_KHR}, which informs the user what
devices can synchronize with each other natively on the device-side, or
through {CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_PLATFORM_UNIVERSAL_SYNC_KHR}, which allows
synchronization between all devices in a platform, falling back to host-side
synchronization when device-side synchronization is not available.
These two mechanisms are referred to as **device-side sync** and **universal
sync** respectively.

If these mechanisms do not report that more than one device can be used in a
command-buffer, it will still be possible to perform multiple queue
recording in a command-buffer if the
{CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_CAPABILITY_MULTIPLE_QUEUE_KHR} capability is reported for
a device.
However, with this capability all the queues commands are recorded to must
target the same device.

Commands recorded to different command-queues in the same command-buffer may
be executed concurrently to each other unless synchronized explicitly with
sync-points, barrier commands, or in-order queue implicit dependencies.
Ordering of other commands submitted to the same command-queues as used to
enqueue a command-buffer is the responsibility of the programmer.
A command-buffer enqueue spanning multiple queues can return an event to use
for synchronization, which will complete once all commands in the
command-buffer have completed.
If ordering restrictions are required, this event (or command-queue
barriers) may be used by the user to synchronize the command-buffer enqueue
with regular commands, or another command-buffer enqueue.

=== Command-Buffer Lifecycle

A command-buffer is always in one of the following states:

[[recording]]
Recording:: Initial state of a command-buffer on creation, where commands can be
recorded to the command-buffer.

[[executable]]
Executable:: State after command recording has finished with
{clFinalizeCommandBufferKHR} and the command-buffer may be enqueued.

[[pending]]
Pending:: Once a command-buffer has been enqueued to a command-queue it enters
the Pending state until completion, at which point it moves back to the
<<executable, Executable>> state.

// ....

image::images/commandbuffer_lifecycle.png[align="center", title="Lifecycle of a command-buffer."]

[[pending_count]]
The Pending Count is the number of copies of the command
buffer in the <<pending, Pending>> state.
By default a command-buffer's Pending Count must be 0 or 1.
If the command-buffer was created with
{CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_KHR} then the command-buffer may have a
Pending Count greater than 1.

[NOTE]
====
The work-group size to be used for _kernel_ can also be specified in the
program source using the
`+__attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(X, Y, Z)))+` qualifier.
In this case the size of work-group specified by _local_work_size_ must
match the value specified by the `reqd_work_group_size` `+__attribute__+`
qualifier.

These work-group instances are executed in parallel across multiple compute
units or concurrently on the same compute unit.

Each work-item is uniquely identified by a global identifier.
The global ID, which can be read inside the kernel, is computed using the
value given by _global_work_size_ and _global_work_offset_.
In addition, a work-item is also identified within a work-group by a unique
local ID.
The local ID, which can also be read by the kernel, is computed using the
value given by _local_work_size_.
The starting local ID is always (0, 0, ... 0).

=== Remapping Command-Buffers

If the {cl_khr_command_buffer_multi_device_EXT} extension is supported,
platforms reporting the {CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_PLATFORM_REMAP_QUEUES_KHR}
capability support generating a deep copy of a command-buffer with its
commands remapped to different devices than the devices used to create the
commands. That is, the remapped command-buffer can execute on queues that
differ in terms of properties and/or associated device from the original
command-buffer queues.

This functionality is invoked through a new synchronous entry-point
{clRemapCommandBufferKHR} which takes a list of queues to which the commands
should now target the associated devices of. It then returns a command-buffer
containing the same commands as the original, with the same command
dependencies, but targeting different devices. A list of command handles may
also be passed to the entry-point, which allows handles to the equivalent
commands in the remapped command-buffer to be returned by an output parameter.

Device properties restrict remapping possibilities, as existing commands can
have a configuration which is not supported by another device, and so
remapping may fail with an error relating to this incompatibility.
Examples of command configurations which can introduce incompatibilities
when trying to map to a new device are:

  * Program language features used in a kernel not supported by the new
    device.
  * ND-Range configuration, e.g exceeds new the device max work-group size.
  * Misalignment of sub-buffers based on minimum alignment of new device.

In additional to this functionality, platforms reporting
{CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_PLATFORM_AUTOMATIC_REMAP_KHR} allow the user to create a
remapped command-buffer where the mapping of queues to commands is
determined by the OpenCL runtime in a way it determines as optimal.
This is particularly useful in hot plugging environments where devices may
appear and disappear during runtime.

  * _errcode_ret_ returns an appropriate error code.
    If _errcode_ret_ is `NULL`, no error code is returned.

=== Mutable Commands

A generic {cl_mutable_command_khr_TYPE} handle is called a _mutable-command_
object as it can be returned from any command recording entry-point in the
{cl_khr_command_buffer_EXT} family of extensions.
The mutable-command handles returned by {clCommandNDRangeKernelKHR} in
particular are referred to as _mutable-dispatch_ objects, and can be
modified through the fields of {cl_mutable_dispatch_config_khr_TYPE}.

Mutable-command handles are updated between enqueues using entry-point
{clUpdateMutableCommandsKHR}.
To enable performant usage, all aspects of mutation can be passed in a single
call using an array. This means that the runtime has access to all the
information about how the command-buffer will change, allowing the
command-buffer to be rebuilt as efficiently as possible.
Any modifications to the arguments or execution info of a mutable-dispatch
handle using {cl_mutable_dispatch_arg_khr_TYPE} or
{cl_mutable_dispatch_exec_info_khr_TYPE} have no affect on the original
kernel object used when the command was recorded, and only influence the
{clCommandNDRangeKernelKHR} command associated with the mutable-dispatch.

[[mutable-dispatch-kernel-argument-safe-usage]]
[NOTE]
====
The base {cl_khr_command_buffer_EXT} extension
<<command-buffer-kernel-argument-ref-counting, notes>> that a command-buffer
does not update the reference count of objects set as arguments on kernels
recorded into the command-buffer.

The implications for applications using {clUpdateMutableCommandsKHR} is that
it is safe to delete objects used as kernel command arguments, if all the
kernel commands using that object as an argument have had their arguments
replaced with a different object.
====

[NOTE]
====
Implementations may defer some of the work to allow {clUpdateMutableCommandsKHR}
to return immediately, provided the user observable behavior in subsequent
command-buffer usage is specification conformant. Deferring work helps keep
device occupancy high by avoiding blocking in host code.

  * _configs_ An array of length _num_configs_ containing structs which define how a
    mutable-command handle in _command_buffer_ is to be updated, each of which is
    interpreted using _config_types_ at the same index with the mapping defined
    in the <<update-config-mapping, Mutable Command Update Structs>> section.

// refError

{clUpdateMutableCommandsKHR} returns {CL_SUCCESS} if all the mutable-command
objects were updated successfully.
Otherwise, none of the updates to mutable-command objects are preserved and
one of the errors below is returned:

  * {CL_INVALID_COMMAND_BUFFER_KHR} if _command_buffer_ is not a valid
    command-buffer.
  * {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if _command_buffer_ has not been finalized.
  * {CL_INVALID_OPERATION} if _command_buffer_ was not created with the
    {CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_MUTABLE_KHR} flag.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _config_types_ is `NULL` and _num_configs_ > 0, or
    _config_types_ is not `NULL` and _num_configs_ is 0.
  * {CL_INVALID_VALUE} if _configs_ is `NULL` and _num_configs_ > 0, or
    _configs_ is not `NULL` and _num_configs_ is 0.

    required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.
  * {CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY} if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.

Using this function when _command_buffer_ is in the <<pending, pending>>
state and not created with the {CL_COMMAND_BUFFER_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_KHR} flag
causes undefined behavior.

[NOTE]
====
Performant usage is to call {clUpdateMutableCommandsKHR} only when the
desired state of all commands is known, rather than iteratively updating
each command individually.

{CL_MUTABLE_DISPATCH_ASSERT_NO_ADDITIONAL_WORK_GROUPS_KHR}, or the updated
ND-range command has been recorded with this flag, and the ND-range
parameters are updated so that the new number of work-groups exceeds the
number when the ND-range command was recorded, the behavior is undefined.

OpenCL device(s) corresponding to an OpenGL context may be queried.
Such a device may not always exist (for example, if an OpenGL context is
specified on a GPU not supporting OpenCL command-queues, but which does
support shared OpenCL/OpenGL memory objects), and if it does exist, may
change over time.
When such a device does exist, acquiring and releasing shared OpenCL/OpenGL
memory objects may be faster on a command-queue corresponding to this device
than on command-queues corresponding to other devices available to an OpenCL
context.
