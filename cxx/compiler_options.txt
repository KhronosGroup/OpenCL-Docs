[[compiler_options]]
== Compiler options

The compiler options are categorized as preprocessor options, options for controlling the OpenCL {cpp} version, options that control FP16 and FP64 support.
This specification defines a standard set of options that must be supported by the compiler when building program executables online or offline from OpenCL {cpp} to an IL.
These may be extended by a set of vendor or platform specific options.

[[preprocessor_options]]
=== Preprocessor options

These options control the OpenCL {cpp} preprocessor which is run on each program source before actual compilation.

----
-D name
----

Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.

----
-D name=definition
----

The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a `#define` directive.
In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline characters.

[[options-controlling_the-opencl_c_version]]
=== Options Controlling the OpenCL {cpp} version

The following option controls the version of OpenCL {cpp} that the compiler accepts.

----
-cl-std=
----

Determine the OpenCL {cpp} language version to use.
A value for this option must be provided.
Valid values are:

  * c++ - Support all OpenCL {cpp} programs that use the OpenCL {cpp} language features defined in the <<openclcpp-programming-language, _OpenCL {cpp} Programming Language_>> section.

[[fp16_and_fp64_options]]
=== Double and half-precision floating-point options

The following option controls the double and half floating-point support that the compiler accepts.

----
-cl-fp16-enable
----

This option enables full half data type support.
The option defines `cl_khr_fp16` macro.
The default is disabled.

----
-cl-fp64-enable
----

This option enables double data type support.
The option defines `cl_khr_fp64` macro.
The default is disabled.

[[other_options]]
=== Other options

----
-cl-zero-init-local-mem-vars
----

This option enables software zero-initialization of variables allocated in local memory.
