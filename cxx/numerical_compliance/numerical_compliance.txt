== OpenCL Numerical Compliance

This section describes features of the {cpp14} and IEEE 754 standards that must be supported by all OpenCL compliant devices.

This section describes the functionality that must be supported by all OpenCL devices for single precision floating-point numbers.
Currently, only single precision and half precision floating-point is a requirement.
Double precision floating-point is an optional feature.
