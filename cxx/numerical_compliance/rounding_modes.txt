[[rounding-modes-1]]
=== Rounding Modes

Floating-point calculations may be carried out internally with extra precision and then rounded to fit into the destination type.
IEEE 754 defines four possible rounding modes:

  * Round to nearest even.
  * Round toward +infinity.
  * Round toward -infinity.
  * Round toward zero.

_Round to nearest even_ is currently the only rounding mode required [[ftnref30]] <<ftn30,[30]>> by the OpenCL specification for single precision and double precision operations and is therefore the default rounding mode.
In addition, only static selection of rounding mode is supported.
Static and dynamic selection of rounding mode is not supported.
