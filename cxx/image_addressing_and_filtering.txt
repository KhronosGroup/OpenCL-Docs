[[image-addressing-and-filtering]]
== Image Addressing and Filtering

Let w~t~, h~t~ and d~t~ be the width, height (or image array size for a 1D image array) and depth (or image array size for a 2D image array) of the image in pixels.
Let coord.xy also referred to as (s,t) or coord.xyz also referred to as (s,t,r) be the coordinates specified to `image::read`.
The sampler specified in `image::read` is used to determine how to sample the image and return an appropriate color.

[[image-coordinates]]
=== Image Coordinates

This affects the interpretation of image coordinates.
If image coordinates specified to `image::read` are normalized (as specified in the sampler), the s,t, and r coordinate values are multiplied by w~t~, h~t,~ and d~t~ respectively to generate the unnormalized coordinate values.
For image arrays, the image array coordinate (i.e. t if it is a 1D image array or r if it is a 2D image array) specified to `image::read` must always be the unnormalized image coordinate value.

Let (u,v,w) represent the unnormalized image coordinate values.

[[addressing-and-filter-modes]]
=== Addressing and Filter Modes

We first describe how the addressing and filter modes are applied to generate the appropriate sample locations to read from the image if the addressing mode is not `addressing_mode::repeat` nor `addressing_mode::mirrored_repeat`.

After generating the image coordinate (u,v,w) we apply the appropriate addressing and filter mode to generate the appropriate sample locations to read from the image.

If values in (u,v,w) are INF or NaN, the behavior of `image::read` is undefined.

[[filtering_modenearest]]
==== filtering_mode::nearest

When filter mode is `filtering_mode::nearest`, the image element in the image that is nearest (in Manhattan distance) to that specified by (u,v,w) is obtained.
This means the image element at location (i,j,k) becomes the image element value, where

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{array}{rcl}
i &=& address\_mode((int)floor(u))\\
j &=& address\_mode((int)floor(v))\\
k &=& address\_mode((int)floor(w))
\end{array}
++++

For a 3D image, the image element at location (i, j, k) becomes the color value.
For a 2D image, the image element at location (i, j) becomes the color value.

The below table describes the `address_mode` function.

The size term in <<addressing_modes_to_generate_texel_location,Addressing modes to generate texel location>> table is w~t~ for u, h~t~ for v and d~t~ for w.

The clamp function used in <<addressing_modes_to_generate_texel_location,Addressing modes to generate texel location>> table is defined as:

[none]
* latexmath:[clamp(a, b, c) = return (a < b) ? b : ((a > c) ? c : a)]

If the selected texel location (i,j,k) refers to a location outside the image, the border color is used as the color value for this texel.

[[filtering_modelinear]]
==== filtering_mode::linear

When filter mode is `filtering_mode::linear`, a 2 x 2 square of image elements for a 2D image or a 2 x 2 x 2 cube of image elements for a 3D image is selected.
This 2 x 2 square or 2 x 2 x 2 cube is obtained as follows.

a  & = frac(u - 0.5)\\

where T~ij~ is the image element at location (i,j) in the 2D image.

If any of the selected T~ijk~ or T~ij~ in the above equations refers to a location outside the image, the border color is used as the color value for T~ijk~ or T~ij~.

If the image channel type is `CL_FLOAT` or `CL_HALF_FLOAT` and any of the image elements T~ijk~ or T~ij~ is INF or NaN, the behavior of the built-in image read function is undefined.

We now discuss how the addressing and filter modes are applied to generate the appropriate sample locations to read from the image if the addressing mode is `addressing_mode::repeat`.

If values in (s,t,r) are INF or NaN, the behavior of the built-in image read functions is undefined.

Let

If the image channel type is `CL_FLOAT` or `CL_HALF_FLOAT` and any of the image elements T~ijk~ or T~ij~ is INF or NaN, the behavior of the built-in image read function is undefined.

We now discuss how the addressing and filter modes are applied to generate the appropriate sample locations to read from the image if the addressing mode is `addressing_mode::repeat`.
The `addressing_mode::mirrored_repeat` addressing mode causes the image to be read as if it is tiled at every integer seam with the interpretation of the image data flipped at each integer crossing.
For example, the (s,t,r) coordinates between 2 and 3 are addressed into the image as coordinates from 1 down to 0.
If values in (s,t,r) are INF or NaN, the behavior of the built-in image read functions is undefined.

If the image channel type is `CL_FLOAT` or `CL_HALF_FLOAT` and any of the image elements T~ijk~ or T~ij~ is INF or NaN, the behavior of the built-in image read function is undefined.

NOTE: If the sampler is specified as using unnormalized coordinates (floating-point or integer coordinates), filter mode set to `filtering_mode::nearest` and addressing mode set to one of the following modes - `addressing_mode::none`, `addressing_mode::clamp_to_edge` or `addressing_mode::clamp`, the location of the image element in the image given by (i, j, k) will be computed without any loss of precision.
For all other sampler combinations of normalized or unnormalized coordinates, filter and addressing modes, the relative error or precision of the addressing mode calculations and the image filter operation are not defined by this revision of the OpenCL specification.
To ensure a minimum precision of image addressing and filter calculations across any OpenCL device, for these sampler combinations, developers should unnormalize the image coordinate in the kernel and implement the linear filter in the kernel with appropriate calls to `image::read` with a sampler that uses unnormalized coordinates, filter mode set to `filtering_mode::nearest`, addressing mode set to `addressing_mode::none`, `addressing_mode::clamp_to_edge` or `addressing_mode::clamp` and finally performing the interpolation of color values read from the image to generate the filtered color value.

In this section we discuss converting normalized integer channel data types to half-precision and single-precision floating-point values and vice-versa.

===== Converting normalized integer channel data types to half precision floating-point values

For images created with image channel data type of `CL_UNORM_INT8` and `CL_UNORM_INT16`, `image::read` will convert the channel values from an 8-bit or 16-bit unsigned integer to normalized half precision floating-point values in the range [0.0h ... 1.0h].

For images created with image channel data type of `CL_SNORM_INT8` and `CL_SNORM_INT16`, `image::read` will convert the channel values from an 8-bit or 16-bit signed integer to normalized half precision floating-point values in the range [-1.0h ... 1.0h].

These conversions are performed as follows:

The precision of the above conversions is \<= 1.5 ulp except for the following cases.

For `CL_UNORM_INT8`:

  * 0 must convert to 0.0h and
  * 255 must convert to 1.0h

For images created with image channel data type of `CL_SNORM_INT8` and `CL_SNORM_INT16`, `image::write` will convert the half precision floating-point color value to an 8-bit or 16-bit signed integer.

When approximate rounding is used instead of the preferred rounding, the result of the conversion must satisfy the bound given below.

===== Converting floating-point values to normalized integer channel data types

For images created with image channel data type of `CL_UNORM_INT8` and `CL_UNORM_INT16`, `image::write` will convert the floating-point color value to an 8-bit or 16-bit unsigned integer.

For images created with image channel data type of `CL_SNORM_INT8` and `CL_SNORM_INT16`, `image::write` will convert the floating-point color value to an 8-bit or 16-bit signed integer.

OpenCL implementations may choose to approximate the rounding mode used in the conversions described below.
When approximate rounding is used instead of the preferred rounding, the result of the conversion must satisfy the bound given below.

The conversions from half precision floating-point values to normalized integer values are performed is as follows:

==== Conversion rules for half precision floating-point channel data type

For images created with a channel data type of `CL_HALF_FLOAT`, the conversions of half to float and half to half are lossless (as described in the <<builtin-half-data-type, _Built-in Half Data Type_>> section).
Conversions from float to half round the mantissa using the round to nearest even or round to zero rounding mode.
Denormalized numbers for the half data type which may be generated when converting a float to a half  may be flushed to zero.
A float NaN must be converted to an appropriate NaN in the half type.
A float INF must be converted to an appropriate INF in the half type.

[[conversion-rules-for-floating-point-channel-data-type]]
==== Conversion rules for floating-point channel data type

The following rules apply for reading and writing images created with channel data type of `CL_FLOAT`.

  * NaNs may be converted to a NaN value(s) supported by the device.
  * Denorms can be flushed to zero.
  * All other values must be preserved.

==== Conversion rules for sRGBA and sBGRA images

Standard RGB data, which roughly displays colors in a linear ramp of luminosity levels such that an average observer, under average viewing conditions, can view them as perceptually equal steps on an average display.
All 0's maps to 0.0f, and all 1's maps to 1.0f.
The sequence of unsigned integer encodings between all 0's and all 1's represent a nonlinear progression in the floating-point interpretation of the numbers between 0.0f to 1.0f.
For more detail, see the <<sRGB-spec, SRGB color standard>>.

Conversion from sRGB space is automatically done by image::read built-in functions if the image channel order is one of the sRGB values described above.
When reading from an sRGB image, the conversion from sRGB to linear RGB is performed before the filter specified in the sampler specified to image::sample is applied.
If the format has an alpha channel, the alpha data is stored in linear color space.
Conversion to sRGB space is automatically done by image::write built-in functions if the image channel order is one of the sRGB values described above and the device supports writing to sRGB images.

If the format has an alpha channel, the alpha data is stored in linear color space.

=== Selecting an Image from an Image Array

Let (u,v,w)  represent the unnormalized image coordinate values for reading from and/or writing to a 2D image in a 2D image array.

When read using a sampler, the 2D image layer selected is computed as:

[latexmath]
++++
layer = clamp(rint(w), 0, d_t - 1)
++++

otherwise the layer selected is computed as:

[latexmath]
++++
layer = w

(since w is already an integer) and the result is undefined if w is not one of the integers 0, 1, ... d~t~ - 1.

Let (u,v)  represent the unnormalized image coordinate values for reading from and/or writing to a 1D image in a 1D image array.

When read using a sampler, the 1D image layer selected is computed as:

layer = clamp(rint(v), 0, h_t - 1)
