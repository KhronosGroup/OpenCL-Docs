[[address-spaces]]
=== Address Spaces

The OpenCL {cpp} kernel language doesn't introduce any explicit named address spaces, but they are implemented as part of the standard library described in the <<address-spaces-library, _Address Spaces Library_>> section.
There are 4 types of memory supported by all OpenCL devices: global, local, private and constant.
The developers should be aware of them and know their limitations.

[[implicit-storage-classes]]
==== Implicit Storage Classes

The OpenCL {cpp} compiler can deduce an address space based on the scope where an object is declared:

  * If a variable is declared in program scope, with `static` or `extern` specifier and the standard library storage class (see the <<address-spaces-library, _Address Spaces Library_>> section) is not used, the variable is allocated in the global memory of a device.
  * If a variable is declared in function scope, without `static` specifier and the standard library storage class (see the <<address-spaces-library, _Address Spaces Library_>> section) is not used, the variable is allocated in the private memory of a device.

[[memory-pools]]
==== Memory Pools

[[global]]
===== Global

The variables are allocated from the global memory pool if they meet the criteria described in the <<implicit-storage-classes, _Implicit Storage Classes_>> section for the implicit global storage class or they are declared using explicit global storage class from the standard library (see the <<global-class, _global class_>> section).

The global memory objects can be:

  * Passed by pointer or reference to a kernel from the host.
    In such case the host manages their visibility, lifetime and a type of allocation.
  * Declared in the program source (`static`, `extern` and program scope global variables).
    In such case they are:
  ** the coarse-grained SVM allocations that can be usable by multiple kernels on the same device safely
  ** not shared across devices
  ** not accessible from the host
  ** their lifetime is the same as a program

The non-trivial constructors and destructors are supported with limitations described in the <<memory-initialization, _Memory initialization_>> section.

The constructors of objects in global memory are executed before the first kernel execution in the program.
The destructors executed at program release time.

The additional restrictions may apply if the explicit global storage class is used.
Please refer to the <<restrictions-2, _Restrictions_>> section for more details.

[[local]]
===== Local

The local variables can be only allocated in a program using the explicit local storage class from the standard library (see the <<local-class, _local class_>> section).
This type of memory is allocated for each work-group executing the kernel and exist only for the lifetime of the work-group executing the kernel.

The non-trivial constructors and destructors are supported with limitations described in the <<memory-initialization, _Memory initialization_>> section.

The constructors of objects in local memory are executed by one work-item before the kernel body execution.
The destructors are executed by one work-item after the kernel body execution.

NOTE: initialization of local variables can cause performance degradation.

The additional restrictions may apply if the explicit local storage class is used.
Please refer to the <<restrictions-2, _Restrictions_>> section for more details.

[[private]]
===== Private

The variables are allocated from the private memory pool if they meet the criteria described in <<implicit-storage-classes,Implicit Storage Classes>> for the implicit private storage class or they were declared using explicit private storage class from the standard library (see the <<priv-class, _priv class_>> section).

The non-trivial constructors and destructors are supported.

The additional restrictions may apply if the explicit priv storage class is used.
Please refer to the <<restrictions-2, _Restrictions_>> section for more details.

[[constant]]
===== Constant

The constant variables can be only allocated in a program using the explicit constant storage class from the standard library (see the <<constant-class, _constant class_>> section).
The variables declared using the `constant<T>` class refer to memory objects allocated from the global memory pool and which are accessed inside a kernel(s) as read-only variables.
These read-only variables can be accessed by all (global) work-items of the kernel during its execution.

The constant objects must be constructible at compile time, they cannot have any user defined constructors, destructors, methods and operators.
Otherwise behavior is undefined.

The additional restrictions may apply if the explicit constant storage class is used.
Please refer to the <<restrictions-2, _Restrictions_>> section for more details.

[[pointers-and-references]]
==== Pointers and references

All {cpp} pointers and references point to an object in the unnamed/generic address space if the explicit address space pointer classes are not used.
The explicit address space pointer classes are implemented as a part of the standard library and they are described in the <<explicit-address-space-pointer-classes, _Explicit address space pointer classes_>> section.
