[[device-enqueue-library]]
=== Device Enqueue Library

OpenCL {cpp} device enqueue functionality allows a kernel to enqueue the same device, without host interaction.
A kernel may enqueue code represented by lambda syntax, and control execution order with event dependencies including user events and markers.
`device_queue` follows all the rules for marker types as specified in the <<marker-types, _Marker Types_>> section.

[[device_queue-class-methods]]
==== device_queue class methods

`device_queue` object represents work queue of the device.
Device queue meets all requirements of the marker types as in the <<marker-types, _Marker Types_>> section.

[[enqueue_kernel]]
===== device_queue::enqueue_kernel

[source]
----
template <class Fun, class... Args>
enqueue_status enqueue_kernel(enqueue_policy policy,
                              const ndrange &ndrange,
                              Fun fun,
                              Args... args) noexcept;
----

This method allows to enqueue functor or lambda `fun` on the device with specified `policy` over the specified `ndrange`.

`args` are the arguments that will be passed to `fun` when kernel will be enqueued with the exception for `local_ptr` parameters.
For local pointers user must supply the size of local memory that will be allocated using `local_ptr<T>::size_type\{num elements}`.
Please see examples how to use `enqueue_kernel` are in the <<examples-7, _Examples_>> section.
[source]
----
template <class Fun, class... Args>
enqueue_status enqueue_kernel(enqueue_policy policy,
                              uint num_events_in_wait_list,
                              const event *event_wait_list,
                              event *event_ret,

                              Args... args) noexcept;
----

This method enqueues functor or lambda `fun` in the same way as the overload above with the exception for the passed event list.
If an event is returned, `enqueue_kernel` performs an implicit retain on the returned event.

[[enqueue_marker]]
===== device_queue::enqueue_marker
[source]
----
enqueue_status enqueue_marker(uint num_events_in_wait_list,
                              const event *event_wait_list,
                              event *event_ret) noexcept;
----

This method enqueues a marker to device queue.
The marker command waits for a list of events specified by `event_wait_list` to complete before the marker completes.
`event_ret` must not be `nullptr` as otherwise this is a no-op.

If an event is returned, `enqueue_marker` performs an implicit retain on the returned event.

[[event-class-methods]]
==== event class methods

[[is_valid]]
===== event::is_valid
[source]
----
bool is_valid() const noexcept;
----

Returns `true` if event object is a valid event.
Otherwise returns `false`.

[[operator-bool]]
===== event::operator bool
[source]
----
explicit operator bool() const noexcept;
----

Returns `true` if event object is a valid event.
Otherwise returns `false`.

[[retain]]
===== event::retain
[source]
----
void retain() noexcept;
----

Increments the event reference count.
Event must be an event returned by `enqueue_kernel` or `enqueue_marker` or a user event.

[[release]]
===== event::release
[source]
----
void release() noexcept;
----

Decrements the event reference count.
The event object is deleted once the event reference count is zero, the specific command identified by this event has completed (or terminated) and there are no commands in any device command queue that require a wait for this event to complete.
Event must be an event returned by `enqueue_kernel`, `enqueue_marker` or a user event.

[[set_status]]
===== event::set_status
[source]
----
void set_status(event_status status) noexcept;
----

Sets the execution status of a user event.
Event must be a user event.
`status` can be either `event_status::complete` or `event_status::error` value indicating an error.

[[profiling_info]]
===== event::profiling_info
[source]
----
void profiling_info(event_profiling_info name,
                    global_ptr<long> value) noexcept;
----

Captures the profiling information for functions that are enqueued as commands.
The specific function being referred to is: `enqueue_kernel`.
These enqueued commands are identified by unique event objects.
The profiling information will be available in `value` once the command identified by event has completed.
Event must be an event returned by `enqueue_kernel`.

`name` identifies which profiling information is to be queried and can be:

  * `event_profiling_info::exec_time`
+
`value` is a pointer to two 64-bit values.
+
The first 64-bit value describes the elapsed time `CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_END - CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_START` for the command identified by event in nanoseconds.
+
The second 64-bit value describes the elapsed time `CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_COMPLETE - CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_START` for the command identified by event in nanoseconds.

NOTE: `profiling_info` when called multiple times for the same event is undefined.

[[get_default_device_queue]]
===== get_default_device_queue
[source]
----
device_queue get_default_device_queue();
----

Returns the default device queue.

event make_user_event();
----

Creates a user event.
Returns the user event.
The execution status of the user event created is set to `event_status::submitted`.

----

Returns the preferred multiple of work-group size for launch.

[[determining-when-a-parent-kernel-has-finished-execution]]
==== Determining when a parent kernel has finished execution

A parent kernel's execution status is considered to be complete when it and all its child kernels have finished execution.
The execution status of a parent kernel will be `event_status::complete` if this kernel and all its child kernels finish execution successfully.
The execution status of the kernel will be `event_status::error` if it or any of its child kernels encounter an error, or are abnormally terminated.

For example, assume that the host enqueues a kernel `k` for execution on a device.
Kernel `k` when executing on the device enqueues kernels `A` and `B` to a device queue(s).
The `enqueue_kernel` call to enqueue kernel `B` specifies the event associated with kernel `A` in the `event_wait_list` argument i.e. wait for kernel `A` to finish execution before kernel `B` can begin execution.
Let's assume kernel `A` enqueues kernels `X`, `Y` and `Z`.
Kernel `A` is considered to have finished execution i.e. its execution status is `event_status::complete` only after `A` and the kernels `A` enqueued (and any kernels these enqueued kernels enqueue and so on) have finished execution.

[[event-profiling-info]]
==== Event profiling info
[source]
----
enum class event_profiling_info
{
    exec_time,
};
----

Event profiling info enumerable is used to determine the outcome of `event::profiling_info` function.
It is defined as follows:

.Event profiling info
[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header"]
|====
| *Status*
| *Description*

| `exec_time`
|
  Identifies profiling information to be queried.
  If specified, the two 64-bit values are returned

  The first 64-bit value describes the elapsed time: `CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_END - CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_START` for the command identified by event in nanoseconds.

  The second 64-bit value describes the elapsed time `CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_COMPLETE - CL_PROFILING_COMMAND_START` for the command identified by event in nanoseconds.
|====

[[requirements-1]]
==== Requirements

Functor and lambda objects passed to `enqueue_kernel` method of device queue has to follow specific restrictions:

  * It has to be trivially copyable.
  * It has to be trivially copy constructible.
  * It has to be trivially destructible.

Code enqueuing function objects that do not meet this criteria is ill-formed.

[[pointers-references-and-marker-types]]
===== Pointers, references and marker types

Functors that are enqueued cannot have any reference and pointer fields, nor can have fields of marker types.
If object containing such fields is enqueued the behavior is undefined.

The same restrictions apply to _capture-list_ variables in lambda.

NOTE: This requirements are caused by the fact that kernel may be enqueued after parent kernel terminated all pointers and references will be invalidated by then.

[[events]]
===== Events

Events can be used to identify commands enqueued to a command-queue from the host.
These events created by the OpenCL runtime can only be used on the host i.e. as events passed in `event_wait_list` argument to various `clEnqueue`* APIs or runtime APIs that take events as arguments such as `clRetainEvent`, `clReleaseEvent`, `clGetEventProfilingInfo`.

Similarly, events can be used to identify commands enqueued to a device queue (from a kernel).
These event objects cannot be passed to the host or used by OpenCL runtime APIs such as the `clEnqueue`* APIs or runtime APIs that take event arguments.

`clRetainEvent` and `clReleaseEvent` will return `CL_INVALID_OPERATION` if event specified is an event that refers to any kernel enqueued to a device queue using `enqueue_kernel` or `enqueue_marker` or is a user event created by `make_user_event`.

Similarly, `clSetUserEventStatus` can only be used to set the execution status of events created using `clCreateUserEvent`.
User events created on the device can be set using `event::set_status` method.

[[restrictions-6]]
==== Restrictions

  * The `device_queue` type cannot be used with variables declared inside a class or union field, a pointer type, an array, global variables declared at program scope or the return type of a function.
  * The `event` type cannot be used with variables declared inside a class or union field, global variables declared at program scope or the return type of a function.
  * The `event` and `device_queue` type cannot be used with the `global`, `local`, `priv` and `constant` address space storage classes (see the <<explicit-address-space-storage-classes, _Explicit address space storage classes_>> section).
  * The values returned by applying the `sizeof` operator to the `device_queue` and `event` types is implementation-defined.
