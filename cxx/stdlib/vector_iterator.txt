[[vector-iterator]]
==== Vector iterator

Vector iterator is a random access iterator that allows runtime iteration over vector channels.
Meets all the requirements for random access iterator.
Iterating outside of vector bounds is an undefined behavior.

The library also exposes non member begin and end functions for vectors.

NOTE: Due to the usage of argument-dependent lookup in range based for loops this functions are not available, and the new range adapter has to be used

There is also an `index` function present in the library that allows runtime numerical indexing of channels.
It returns a channel reference to a given channel number.
Indexing out of vector bounds results in undefined behavior.

The following example will present simple template function computing sum of channels of a given vector:

[source]
----
template<class V>
auto sum(const V& v) {
    vector_element_t<V> temp = 0;
    for(auto e : range(v)) {
        temp += e;
    }
    return temp;
}
----

[[channel-reference-and-channel-pointer]]
==== Channel reference and channel pointer

`channel_ref` and `channel_ptr` classes provide lightweight reference and pointer wrappers for vector channels.
This is required due to the fact that vector channels can be moved across memory during execution so direct physical addressing is impossible.
Reference wrapper provides a set of binary operators (depending on vector channel type).

The following example will present a simple usage of channel reference to set first channel of given vector to 0:

[source]
----
template <class V>
void fun(V& v) {
    channel_ref<V> r = *begin(v);
    r = 0;
}
----

[[get-and-set-functions]]
==== Get and set functions

Get and set functions allow compile time numerical indexing of channels to substitute for normal swizzling.
Indexing out of vector range generates a compile error.
Get function returns a copy of channel value.

The following example will present how get and set functions can be used to duplicate the value of the first channel of given vector:

[source]
----
template <class V>
void fun(V& v) {
    auto c = get< 0 >(v);
    set< 0 >(v, 2*c);
}

==== Examples

[[example-1-8]]
===== Example 1

Example of using built-in vector iterators.

[source]
----
#include <opencl_vector_utility>
#include <opencl_range>
using namespace cl;

kernel void foo() {
    int8 v_i8;
    auto iter_begin = begin(v_i8);
    auto iter_end = end(v_i8);

    iter_begin = iter_end;

    int a = 0;
    a = *iter_begin;
    a = iter_begin[0];

    iter_begin++;
    iter_begin+=1;
    iter_begin = iter_begin + 1;

    iter_begin--;
    iter_begin-=1;
    iter_begin = iter_begin - 1;
}
----

[[example-2-6]]
===== Example 2

Example of iterating though built-in vector channels and using range library.

[source]
----
#include <opencl_vector_utility>
#include <opencl_range>

kernel void foo() {
    int16 a;

    for (auto it = cl::begin(a); it != cl::end(a); it++) {
        int b = *it;
        *it = 2;
    }

    for (auto c : cl::range(a,3,6)) {
        int b = c;
        c = 2;
    }
}
