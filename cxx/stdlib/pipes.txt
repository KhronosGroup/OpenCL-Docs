[[pipes-library]]
=== Pipes Library

Header _<opencl_pipe>_ defines `pipe` and `pipe_storage` template classes.
`pipe` and `pipe_storage` can be used as a communication channel between kernels.
`pipe`, `reservation` and `pipe_storage`  template classes follow all the rules for marker types as specified in the <<marker-types, _Marker Types_>> section.

[[pipe-host-type]]
==== Pipe Host Type

The below describes the OpenCL pipe data type and the corresponding data type available to the application:

The lifetime of `pipe_storage` objects is the same as a program where they were declared.
The variables of such type are not shared across devices.

`N` in the `pipe_storage` template class specifies the maximum number of packets which can be held by an object.
[source]
----
namespace cl
{
template<class T, size_t N>
struct pipe_storage: marker_type
{
    pipe_storage();
    pipe_storage(const pipe_storage&) = default;

};

}
----

[[pipe_storage-class-methods-and-make_pipe-function]]
==== pipe_storage class methods and make_pipe function

[[pipe_storageget]]
===== pipe_storage::get
[source]
----
template<pipe_access Access = pipe_access::read>
pipe<T, Access> get() noexcept;
----

Constructs a read only or write only pipe from `pipe_storage` object.
One kernel can have only one pipe accessor associated with one `pipe_storage` object.

[[make_pipe]]
===== make_pipe
[source]
----
template<pipe_access Access = pipe_access::read, class T, size_t N>
pipe<T, Access> make_pipe(const pipe_storage<T, N>& ps);
----

Constructs a read only or write only pipe from `pipe_storage` object.
One kernel can have only one pipe accessor associated with one `pipe_storage` object.

[[operations-ordering-using-reservations]]
==== Operations ordering using reservations

The `reservation::read` and `reservation::write` pipe functions can be used to read from or write to a packet index.
These functions can be used to read from or write to a packet index one or multiple times.
If a packet index that is reserved for writing is not written to using the `reservation::write` method, the contents of that packet in the pipe are undefined.
`reservation::commit` remove the entries reserved for reading from the pipe.
`reservation::commit` ensures that the entries reserved for writing are all added in-order as one contiguous set of packets to the pipe.

There can only be `CL_DEVICE_PIPE_MAX_ACTIVE_RESERVATIONS` (refer to _Table 4.3_) reservations active (i.e. reservations that have been reserved but not committed) per work-item or work-group for a pipe in a kernel executing on a device.

Work-item based reservations made by a work-item are ordered in the pipe as they are ordered in the program.
Reservations made by different work-items that belong to the same work-group can be ordered using the work-group barrier function.
The order of work-item based reservations that belong to different work-groups is implementation defined.

Work-group based reservations made by a work-group are ordered in the pipe as they are ordered in the program.
The order of work-group based reservations by different work-groups is implementation defined.

[[requirements]]
==== Requirements

[[data]]
===== Data

Template parameter `T` in `pipe` and `pipe_storage` class template denotes the data type stored in pipe.
The type `T` must be a POD type i.e. satisfy `is_pod<T>::value == true`.

[[work-group-operations]]
===== Work-group operations

All work-group specific functions must be encountered by all work items in a work-group executing the kernel with the same argument values, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

[[sub-group-operations]]
===== Sub-group operations

All sub-group specific functions must be encountered by all work items in a sub-group executing the kernel with the same argument values, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

[[restrictions-5]]
==== Restrictions

[[pipe]]
===== pipe

  * The `pipe` type cannot be used with variables declared inside a class or union field, a pointer type, an array, global variables declared at program scope or the return type of a function.
  * A kernel cannot read from and write to the same pipe object.
  * The `pipe` type cannot be used with the `global`, `local`, `priv` and `constant` address space storage classes (see the <<explicit-address-space-storage-classes, _Explicit address space storage classes_>> section).
  * The value returned by applying the `sizeof` operator to the `pipe` type is implementation-defined.

[[reservation]]
===== reservation

  * The `reservation` type cannot be used with variables declared inside a class or union field, a pointer type, an array, global variables declared at program scope or the return type of a function.
  * The `reservation` type cannot be used with the `global`, `local`, `priv` and `constant` address space storage classes (see the <<explicit-address-space-storage-classes, _Explicit address space storage classes_>> section).
  * The value returned by applying the `sizeof` operator to the `reservation` type is implementation-defined.


The following behavior is undefined:

  * A kernel calls `reservation::read` or `reservation::write` with a valid reservation but with an index that is not a value from `0 ... num_packets - 1` specified to the corresponding call to `pipe::reserve`, `pipe::work_group_reserve` or `pipe::sub_group_reserve`.
  * A kernel calls `reservation::read` or `reservation::write` with a reservation that has already been committed (i.e. a `reservation::commit` with this reservation has already been called).
  * The contents of the reserved data packets in the pipe are undefined if the kernel does not call `reservation::write` for all entries that were reserved by the corresponding call to `pipe::reserve`, `pipe::work_group_reserve` or `pipe::sub_group_reserve`.
  * Calls to `reservation::read` and `reservation::commit` or `reservation::write` and `reservation::commit` for a given reservation must be called by the same kernel that made the reservation using `pipe::reserve`, `pipe::work_group_reserve` or `pipe::sub_group_reserve`. The reservation cannot be passed to another kernel including child kernels.

[[pipe_storage]]
===== pipe_storage

  * Variables of type `pipe_storage` can only be declared at program scope or with the static specifier.
  * The `pipe_storage` type cannot be used as a class or union field, a pointer type, an array or the return type of a function.
  * The `pipe_storage` type cannot be used with the `global`, `local`, `priv` and `constant` address space storage classes (see the <<explicit-address-space-storage-classes, _Explicit address space storage classes_>> section).
  * The value returned by applying the `sizeof` operator to the `pipe_storage` type is implementation-defined.
  * Variables of type `pipe` created from `pipe_storage` can only be declared inside a kernel function at kernel scope.


The following behavior is undefined:

  * A kernel cannot contain more than one `pipe` accessor made from one `pipe_storage` object. Otherwise behavior is undefined.
