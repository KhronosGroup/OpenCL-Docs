[[work_group_barrier]]
===== work_group_barrier

void work_group_barrier(mem_fence flags,
                        memory_scope scope  = memory_scope_work_group);
----

All work-items in a work-group executing the kernel on a processor must execute this function before any are allowed to continue execution beyond the `work_group_barrier`.
This function must be encountered by all work-items in a work-group executing the kernel.
These rules apply to ND-ranges implemented with uniform and non-uniform work-groups.

If `work_group_barrier` is inside a conditional statement, then all work-items must enter the conditional if any work-item enters the conditional statement and executes the `work_group_barrier`.

If `work_group_barrier` is inside a loop, all work-items must execute the `work_group_barrier` for each iteration of the loop before any are allowed to continue execution beyond the `work_group_barrier`.

The `scope` argument specifies whether the memory accesses of work-items in the work-group to memory address space(s) identified by `flags` become visible to all work-items in the work-group, the device or all SVM devices.

The `work_group_barrier` function can also be used to specify which memory operations i.e. to global memory, local memory or images become visible to the appropriate memory scope identified by `scope`.
The `flags` argument specifies the memory address spaces.
This is a bitfield and can be set to 0 or a combination of the following values ORed together.
When these flags are ORed together the `work_group_barrier` acts as a combined barrier for all address spaces specified by the flags ordering memory accesses both within and across the specified address spaces.

  * `mem_fence::local` - The `work_group_barrier` function will ensure that all local memory accesses become visible to all work-items in the work-group.
    Note that the value of `scope` is ignored as the memory scope is always `memory_scope_work_group`.
  * `mem_fence::global` - The `work_group_barrier` function ensure that all global memory accesses become visible to the appropriate scope as given by `scope`.
  * `mem_fence::image` - The `work_group_barrier` function will ensure that all image memory accesses become visible to the appropriate scope as given by `scope`.
    The value of `scope` must be `memory_scope_work_group` or `memory_scope_device`.

`mem_fence::image` cannot be used together with `mem_fence::local` or `mem_fence::global`.

The values of `flags` and `scope` must be the same for all work-items in the work-group.

[[sub_group_barrier]]
===== sub_group_barrier

[source]
----
void sub_group_barrier(mem_fence flags,
                       memory_scope scope = memory_scope_work_group);
----

All work-items in a sub-group executing the kernel on a processor must execute this function before any are allowed to continue execution beyond the sub-group barrier.
This function must be encountered by all work-items in a sub-group executing the kernel.
These rules apply to ND-ranges implemented with uniform and non-uniform work-groups.

If `sub_group_barrier` is inside a conditional statement, then all work-items within the sub-group must enter the conditional if any work-item in the sub-group enters the conditional statement and executes the `sub_group_barrier`.

If `sub_group_barrier` is inside a loop, all work-items within the sub-group must execute the `sub_group_barrier` for each iteration of the loop before any are allowed to continue execution beyond the `sub_group_barrier`.

The `sub_group_barrier` function also queues a memory fence (reads and writes) to ensure correct ordering of memory operations to local or global memory.

The `flags` argument specifies the memory address spaces.
This is a bitfield and can be set to 0 or a combination of the following values ORed together.
When these flags are ORed together the `sub_group_barrier` acts as a combined barrier for all address spaces specified by the flags ordering memory accesses both within and across the specified address spaces.

`mem_fence::local` - The `sub_group_barrier` function will ensure that all local memory accesses become visible to all work-items in the sub-group.
Note that the value of `scope` is ignored as the memory scope is always `memory_scope_work_group`.

`mem_fence::global` - The `sub_group_barrier` function ensure that all global memory accesses become visible to the appropriate scope as given by `scope`.

`mem_fence::image` - The `sub_group_barrier` function will ensure that all image memory accesses become visible to the appropriate scope as given by `scope`.
The value of `scope` must be `memory_scope_work_group` or `memory_scope_device`.

`mem_fence::image` cannot be used together with `mem_fence::local` or `mem_fence::global`.

The values of `flags` and `scope` must be the same for all work-items in the sub-group.

[[named-barriers]]
==== Named barriers

This section describes the optional *cl_khr_sub_group_named_barrier* extension which exposes the ability to perform barrier synchronization on flexible portions of an execution domain.

If the *cl_khr_sub_group_named_barrier* extension is supported by a device, an application that wants to use it will need to define the `cl_khr_sub_group_named_barrier` macro before including the OpenCL {cpp} standard library headers or using the _-D_ compiler option (<<preprocessor_options,_Preprocessor options_>> section).

An implementation shall support at least 8 named barriers per work-group.
The exact maximum number can be queried using `clGetDeviceInfo` with `CL_DEVICE_MAX_NAMED_BARRIER_COUNT_KHR` from the OpenCL 2.2 Extension Specification.

Restrictions:

  * The `work_group_named_barrier` type cannot be used with variables declared inside a class or union field, a pointer type, an array, global variables declared at program scope or the return type of a function.
  * The `work_group_named_barrier` type cannot be used with the `global`, `priv` and `constant` address space storage classes (see the the <<explicit-address-space-storage-classes, _Explicit address space storage classes_>> section).
  * The value returned by applying the `sizeof` operator to the `work_group_named_barrier` type is implementation-defined.

[[work_group_named_barrier]]
===== work_group_named_barrier

[source]
----
work_group_named_barrier(uint sub_group_count);
----

Initialize a new named barrier object to synchronize `sub_group_count` sub-groups in the current work-group.
Construction of a named-barrier object is a work-group operation and hence must be called uniformly across the work-group.
`sub_group_count` must be uniform across the work-group.

Named barrier objects can be reconstructed and assigned to underlying entities by the compiler, or reused.
Reused barriers will always be the same size and act in phases such that when each participating sub-group has waited the wait count is set to 0 and the entire process can start again.
The internal wait count will cycle through the range from `0` to `sub_group_count` in each phase of use of the barrier.

Named barrier objects can only be constructed within kernels, not within arbitrary functions.

[[wait]]
===== wait
[source]
----
void wait(mem_fence flags,
          memory_scope scope = memory_scope_work_group) const noexcept;
----

All work-items in a sub-group executing the kernel on a processor must execute this method before any are allowed to continue execution beyond the barrier.
This function must be encountered by all work-items in a sub-group executing the kernel.

These rules apply to ND-ranges implemented with uniform and non-uniform work-groups.

If `wait` is called inside a conditional statement, then all work-items within the sub-group must enter the conditional if any work-item in the sub-group enters the conditional statement and executes the call to wait.

If `wait` is called inside a loop, all work-items within the sub-group must execute the wait operation for each iteration of the loop before any are allowed to continue execution beyond the call to wait.
The wait function causes the entire sub-group to wait until `sub_group_count` sub-groups have waited on the named barrier, where `sub_group_count` is the initialization value passed to the call to the constructor of the named barrier.
Once the wait count equals `sub_group_count`, any sub-groups waiting at the named barrier will be released and the barrier's wait count reset to 0.

The `flags` argument specifies the memory address spaces.
This is a bitfield and can be set to 0 or a combination of the following values ORed together.
When these flags are ORed together the wait acts as a combined wait operation for all address spaces specified by the flags ordering memory accesses both within and across the specified address spaces.

`mem_fence::local` - The wait function will ensure that all local memory accesses become visible to all work-items in the sub-group.
Note that the value of `scope` is ignored as the memory scope is always `memory_scope_work_group`.

`mem_fence::global` - The wait function ensure that all global memory accesses become visible to the appropriate scope as given by `scope`.

`mem_fence::image` cannot be specified as a flag for this function.

The values of `flags` and `scope` must be the same for all work-items in the sub-group.

The below example shows how to use the named barriers:

[source]
----
#include <opencl_memory>
#include <opencl_synchronization>
#include <opencl_work_item>

using namespace cl;

void aFunction(work_group_named_barrier &b) {
    while(...) {
        // Do something in first set
        b.wait(mem_fence::global);
    }
}

kernel void aKernel() {
    // Initialize a set of named barriers
    local<work_group_named_barrier> a(4);
    local<work_group_named_barrier> b(2);
    local<work_group_named_barrier> c(2);

    if(get_sub_group_id() < 4) {
        a.wait(mem_fence::local);
        if(get_sub_group_id() < 2) {
            // Pass one of the named barriers to a function by reference
            // Barrier cannot be constructed in a non-kernel function
            aFunction(b);
        } else {
            // Do something else
            c.wait(mem_fence::local);
            // Continue
        }

        // Wait a second time on the first barrier
        a.wait(mem_fence::global);
    }


    // Back to work-group uniform control flow,
    // we can synchronize the entire group if necessary
    work_group_barrier(mem_fence::global);
}
