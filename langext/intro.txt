== Introduction

This document describes The OpenCL C language extensions that can be supported optionally by the compiler in addition to the functionality from the existing standard language versions. To detect whether extension is supported by the compiler special feature macros can be used `\__opencl_c_<feature name>`. Each feature macro has a value corresponding to the publishing date. Some extensions are available in all versions and others only in the specific versions of OpenCL kernel language (see <<lang_ext_list,the full list of lanuage extension>>).
