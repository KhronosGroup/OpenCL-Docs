== OpenCL 1.2

An OpenCL 1.2 environment must accept SPIR-V 1.0 modules if it includes the
optional extension `cl_khr_il_program` in the host API
`CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS` or `CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS` string.

=== Full Profile

An OpenCL 1.2 Full Profile environment is guaranteed to support the
following SPIR-V capabilities:

  * *Addresses*
  * *Float16Buffer*
  * *Groups*
  * *Int64*
  * *Int16*
  * *Int8*
  * *Kernel*
  * *Linkage*
  * *Vector16*

The following capabilities may be optionally supported:

  * *ImageBasic*, if `CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT` is `CL_TRUE`
  * *Float64*, if the device supports double precision floating-point

If *ImageBasic* is supported then the following capabilities must also be
supported:

  * *LiteralSampler*
  * *Sampled1D*
  * *Image1D*
  * *SampledBuffer*
  * *ImageBuffer*

=== Embedded Profile

An OpenCL 1.2 Embedded Profile environment is guaranteed to support the
following SPIR-V capabilities:

  * *Addresses*
  * *Float16Buffer*
  * *Groups*
  * *Int16*
  * *Int8*
  * *Kernel*
  * *Linkage*
  * *Vector16*

The following capabilities may be optionally supported:

  * *ImageBasic*, if `CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT` is `CL_TRUE`
  * *Float64*, if the device supports double precision floating-point

If *ImageBasic* is supported then the following capabilities must also be
supported:

  * *LiteralSampler*
  * *Sampled1D*
  * *Image1D*
  * *SampledBuffer*
  * *ImageBuffer*

=== Validation Rules

The following are a list of validation rules for SPIR-V modules executing in
an OpenCL 1.2 environment:

_Scope_ for _Execution_ is generally limited to:

  * *Workgroup*

_Scope_ for _Memory_ is generally limited to:

  * *CrossDevice*
  * *Device*
  * *Workgroup*
  * *Invocation*

The following *Group Instructions* are not supported:

  * *OpGroupAll*
  * *OpGroupAny*
  * *OpGroupBroadcast*
  * *OpGroupIAdd*
  * *OpGroupFAdd*
  * *OpGroupFMin*
  * *OpGroupUMin*
  * *OpGroupSMin*
  * *OpGroupFMax*
  * *OpGroupUMax*
  * *OpGroupSMax*

For the *Barrier Instructions* *OpControlBarrier* and *OpMemoryBarrier*, the
_Scope_ for execution must be *Workgroup*, the _Scope_ for memory must be
*Workgroup*, and the _Memory Semantics_ must be *SequentiallyConsistent*.

For the *Atomic Instructions*, the _Scope_ must be *Device*, and the _Memory
Semantics_ must be *Relaxed*.
