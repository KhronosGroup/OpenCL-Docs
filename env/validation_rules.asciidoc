== Validation Rules

The following are a list of validation rules that apply to SPIR-V modules
executing in all OpenCL environments:

The _Execution Model_ declared in *OpEntryPoint* must be *Kernel*.

The _Addressing Model_ declared in *OpMemoryModel* must be either:

  * *Physical32* (for OpenCL devices reporting `32` for {CL_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BITS})
  * *Physical64* (for OpenCL devices reporting `64` for {CL_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BITS})
  
The _Memory Model_ declared in *OpMemoryModel* must be *OpenCL*.

For all *OpTypeInt* integer type-declaration instructions:

  * _Signedness_ must be 0, indicating no signedness semantics.
  
For all *OpTypeImage* type-declaration instructions:

  * _Sampled Type_ must be *OpTypeVoid*.
  * _Sampled_ must be 0, indicating that the image usage will be known at
     run time, not at compile time.
  * _MS_ must be 0, indicating single-sampled content.
  * _Arrayed_ may only be set to 1, indicating arrayed content, when _Dim_
     is set to *1D* or *2D*.
  * _Image Format_ must be *Unknown*, indicating that the image does not
     have a specified format.
  * The optional image _Access Qualifier_ must be present.
  
The image write instruction *OpImageWrite* must not include any optional
_Image Operands_.

The image read instructions *OpImageRead* and *OpImageSampleExplicitLod* 
must not include the optional _Image Operand_ *ConstOffset*.

For all *Atomic Instructions*:

  * Only 32-bit integer types are supported for the _Result Type_ and/or
    type of _Value_.
  * The _Pointer_ operand must be a pointer to the *Function*, *Workgroup*,
    or *CrossWorkGroup* _Storage Classes_.  Note that an *Atomic Instruction*
    on a pointer to the *Function* _Storage Class_ is valid, but does not
    have defined behavior.

Recursion is not supported.
The static function call graph for an entry point must not contain cycles.

Whether irreducible control flow is legal is implementation defined.

For the instructions *OpGroupAsyncCopy* and *OpGroupWaitEvents*,
_Scope_ for _Execution_ must be:

  * *Workgroup*

For the *Group and Subgroup Instructions*, _Scope_ for _Execution_ must
be one of:

  * *Workgroup*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting Work Group Collective Functions (where
       {CL_DEVICE_WORK_GROUP_COLLECTIVE_FUNCTIONS_SUPPORT} is {CL_TRUE}).
  * *Subgroup*
    ** For OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices supporting
       Subgroups (where {CL_DEVICE_MAX_NUM_SUB_GROUPS} is not `0`)

For all other instructions, _Scope_ for _Execution_ must be one of:

  * *Workgroup*
  * *Subgroup*
    ** For OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices supporting
       Subgroups (where {CL_DEVICE_MAX_NUM_SUB_GROUPS} is not `0`)

In an OpenCL 1.2 environment,
for the *Barrier Instructions* *OpControlBarrier* and *OpMemoryBarrier*, the
_Scope_ for _Memory_ must be *Workgroup*, and the memory-order constraint in
_Memory Semantics_ must be *SequentiallyConsistent*.
Otherwise, _Scope_ for _Memory_ must be one of:

  * *CrossDevice*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_ALL_DEVICES} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_FENCE_CAPABILITIES}.
  * *Device*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_DEVICE} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_FENCE_CAPABILITIES}.
  * *Workgroup*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_WORK_GROUP} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_FENCE_CAPABILITIES}.
  * *Subgroup*
    ** For OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices supporting
       Subgroups (where {CL_DEVICE_MAX_NUM_SUB_GROUPS} is not `0`).
  * *Invocation*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_WORK_ITEM} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_FENCE_CAPABILITIES}.

And, the memory-order constraint in _Memory Semantics_ must be one of:

  * *None (Relaxed)*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_RELAXED} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_FENCE_CAPABILITIES}.
  * *Acquire*, *Release*, or *AcquireRelease*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_ACQ_REL} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_FENCE_CAPABILITIES}.
  * *SequentiallyConsistent*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_SEQ_CST} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_FENCE_CAPABILITIES}.

In an OpenCL 1.2 environment,
for the *Atomic Instructions*, the _Scope_ for _Memory_ must be *Device*,
and the memory-order constraint in _Memory Semantics_ must be *Relaxed*.
Otherwise, _Scope_ for _Memory_ must be one of:

  * *CrossDevice*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_ALL_DEVICES} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_MEMORY_CAPABILITIES}.
  * *Device*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_DEVICE} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_MEMORY_CAPABILITIES}.
  * *Workgroup*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_SCOPE_WORK_GROUP} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_MEMORY_CAPABILITIES}.
  * *Subgroup*
    ** For OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices supporting
       Subgroups (where {CL_DEVICE_MAX_NUM_SUB_GROUPS} is not `0`).
// From the OpenCL C spec:
// memory_scope_work_item can only be used with atomic_work_item_fence
// with flags set to CLK_IMAGE_MEM_FENCE.
//  * *Invocation*

And, the memory-order constraint in _Memory Semantics_ must be one of:

  * *None (Relaxed)*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_RELAXED} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_MEMORY_CAPABILITIES}.
  * *Acquire*, *Release*, or *AcquireRelease*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_ACQ_REL} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_MEMORY_CAPABILITIES}.
  * *SequentiallyConsistent*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices
       supporting {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_ORDER_SEQ_CST} in
       {CL_DEVICE_ATOMIC_MEMORY_CAPABILITIES}.

For OpenCL environments that support and declare the *GenericPointer*
capability, the _Pointer_ operand to all *Atomic Instructions* may be
a pointer to the *Generic* _Storage Class_, however behavior is still
undefined if the *Generic* pointer represents a pointer to the
*Function* _Storage Class_.
