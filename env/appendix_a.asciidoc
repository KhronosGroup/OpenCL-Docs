Changes to the OpenCL SPIR-V Environment specifications between successive
versions are summarized below.

== Summary of changes from OpenCL 3.0

The first non-provisional version of the OpenCL 3.0 specifications was *v3.0.5*.

Changes from *v3.0.5*:

  * Clarified subgroup barrier behavior in non-uniform control flow.
  * Added required alignment of types.
  * Added new extensions:
      ** `cl_khr_subgroup_extended_types`
      ** `cl_khr_subgroup_non_uniform_vote`
      ** `cl_khr_subgroup_ballot`
      ** `cl_khr_subgroup_non_uniform_arithmetic`
      ** `cl_khr_subgroup_shuffle`
      ** `cl_khr_subgroup_shuffle_relative`
      ** `cl_khr_subgroup_clustered_reduce`

Changes from *v3.0.6*:

  * Explicitly say that *OpTypeSampledImage* may be used in an OpenCL environment.
  * Added the required type for SPIR-V built-in variables.
  * Fixed several bugs and formatting in the fast math ULP tables.
  * Added new extensions:
      ** `cl_khr_extended_bit_ops`
      ** `cl_khr_spirv_extended_debug_info`
      ** `cl_khr_spirv_linkonce_odr`

Changes from *v3.0.8*:
