== Required Capabilities

[[required-capabilities-1.0]]
=== SPIR-V 1.0

An OpenCL environment that supports SPIR-V 1.0 must support SPIR-V 1.0
modules that declare the following capabilities:

  * *Addresses*
  * *Float16Buffer*
  * *Int64* (Full Profile Only)
  * *Int16*
  * *Int8*
  * *Kernel*
  * *Linkage*
  * *Vector16*
  * *DeviceEnqueue* (OpenCL 2.0 and Newer)
  * *GenericPointer* (OpenCL 2.0 and Newer)
  * *Groups* (OpenCL 2.0 and Newer)
  * *Pipes* (OpenCL 2.0 and Newer)
  * *ImageBasic* (if `CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT` is `CL_TRUE`)
  * *Float64* (if the device supports double precision floating-point)

If the OpenCL environment supports the *ImageBasic* capability, then
the following capabilities must also be supported:

  * *LiteralSampler*
  * *Sampled1D*
  * *Image1D*
  * *SampledBuffer*
  * *ImageBuffer*
  * *ImageReadWrite* (OpenCL 2.0 and Newer)

[[required-capabilities-1.1]]
=== SPIR-V 1.1

An OpenCL environment supporting SPIR-V 1.1 must support SPIR-V 1.1
modules that declare the capabilities required for SPIR-V 1.0 modules,
above.

In addition, an OpenCL environment consuming SPIR-V 1.1 must support
SPIR-V 1.1 modules that declare the following capabilities:

  * *SubgroupDispatch* (OpenCL 2.2 and Newer)
  * *PipeStorage* (OpenCL 2.2 and Newer)
  * *Initializer* (OpenCL 2.2 and Newer)
  * *Finalizer* (OpenCL 2.2 and Newer)

[[required-capabilities-1.2]]
=== SPIR-V 1.2

An OpenCL environment supporting SPIR-V 1.2 must support SPIR-V 1.2
modules that declare the capabilities required for SPIR-V 1.1 modules,
above.

SPIR-V 1.2 does not add any new required capabilities.
