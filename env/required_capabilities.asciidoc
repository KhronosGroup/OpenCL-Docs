== Required Capabilities

[[required-capabilities-1.0]]
=== SPIR-V 1.0

An OpenCL environment that supports SPIR-V 1.0 must support SPIR-V 1.0
modules that declare the following capabilities:

  * *Addresses*
  * *Float16Buffer*
  * *Int64*
    ** For Full Profile devices.
  * *Int16*
  * *Int8*
  * *Kernel*
  * *Linkage*
  * *Vector16*
  * *DeviceEnqueue*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices supporting Device-Side Enqueue (where {CL_DEVICE_DEVICE_ENQUEUE_SUPPORT} is {CL_TRUE}).
  * *GenericPointer*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices supporting the Generic Address Space (where {CL_DEVICE_GENERIC_ADDRESS_SPACE_SUPPORT} is {CL_TRUE}).
  * *Groups*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices supporting Subgroups (where {CL_DEVICE_MAX_NUM_SUB_GROUPS} is not `0`) or Work Group Collective Functions (where {CL_DEVICE_WORK_GROUP_COLLECTIVE_FUNCTIONS_SUPPORT} is {CL_TRUE}).
  * *Pipes*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices supporting Pipes (where {CL_DEVICE_PIPE_SUPPORT} is {CL_TRUE}).
  * *ImageBasic*
    ** For devices supporting Images (where {CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT} is {CL_TRUE})
  * *Float64*
    ** For devices supporting Double Precision Floating-Point (where {CL_DEVICE_DOUBLE_FP_CONFIG} is not `0`)

If the OpenCL environment supports the *ImageBasic* capability, then
the following capabilities must also be supported:

  * *LiteralSampler*
  * *Sampled1D*
  * *Image1D*
  * *SampledBuffer*
  * *ImageBuffer*
  * *ImageReadWrite*
    ** For OpenCL 2.0, OpenCL 2.1, OpenCL 2.2, or OpenCL 3.0 devices supporting Read-Write Images (where {CL_DEVICE_MAX_READ_WRITE_IMAGE_ARGS} is not `0`)

[[required-capabilities-1.1]]
=== SPIR-V 1.1

An OpenCL environment supporting SPIR-V 1.1 must support SPIR-V 1.1
modules that declare the capabilities required for SPIR-V 1.0 modules,
above.

In addition, an OpenCL environment consuming SPIR-V 1.1 must support
SPIR-V 1.1 modules that declare the following capabilities:

  * *SubgroupDispatch*
    ** For OpenCL 2.2 devices, or OpenCL 3.0 devices supporting Subgroups (where {CL_DEVICE_MAX_NUM_SUB_GROUPS} is not `0`)
// TODO: Do we need a device query for pipe storage?
//       We do not currently expose pipe storage in OpenCL C.
  * *PipeStorage*
    ** For OpenCL 2.2 devices.
// Removing these for now, see:
// https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Docs/issues/190
// https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Docs/pull/191
//  * *Initializer* (OpenCL 2.2 and Newer)
//  * *Finalizer* (OpenCL 2.2 and Newer)

[[required-capabilities-1.2]]
=== SPIR-V 1.2

An OpenCL environment supporting SPIR-V 1.2 must support SPIR-V 1.2
modules that declare the capabilities required for SPIR-V 1.1 modules,
above.

SPIR-V 1.2 does not add any new required capabilities.
