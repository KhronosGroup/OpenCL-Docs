:fn-opfrem-opfmod: pass:n[ \
The *OpFRem* and *OpFMod* instructions use cheap approximations of remainder, and the error can be large due to the discontinuity in *trunc*() and *floor*(). This can produce mathematically unexpected results in some cases, such as *OpFMod*(x,x) computing x rather than 0, and can also cause the result to have a different sign than the infinitely precise result. \
]

:fn-type-min: pass:n[ \
Here `TYPE_MIN` and `TYPE_MIN_EXP` should be substituted by constants appropriate to the floating-point type under consideration, such as `FLT_MIN` and `FLT_MIN_EXP` for float. \
