[[intro]]
== Introduction

This repository contains the source and tool chain used to generate the
formal OpenCL API, OpenCL Extensions, OpenCL SPIR-V Environment, and
OpenCL C++ Specifications, as well as the OpenCL 2.2 Reference Pages.

This file describes the repository structure, tools, and build instructions
needed.


[[source]]
== Source Code

The OpenCL specifications are maintained by members of the Khronos Group's
OpenCL Working Group, in the
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Docs[OpenCL-Docs Github repository].
The documents are all in https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] format.

Contributions via pull requests on Github are welcome. Pull requests must be
provided under the same <<license, Creative Commons license>> as the
specification source.
You'll be prompted with a one-time "`click-through`" Contributor's License
Agreement (CLA) dialog as part of submitting your pull request or other
contribution to GitHub.

We intend to maintain a linear history on the GitHub `master` branch.

[[building]]
== Building The Specifications and Reference Pages

If you have installed all <<depends,required toolchain components>>, you
should be able to build both HTML and PDF outputs for all specifications by:

    $ make

Other Makefile targets are available for building the different outputs
for each Specification:

|====
| *Target*  | *Builds*
| html      | HTML outputs for all specifications
| pdf       | PDF outputs for all specifications
|           |
| api       | HTML and PDF outputs for API Specification
| apihtml   | HTML outputs for API Specification
| apipdf    | PDF outputs for API Specification
|           |
| cxx       | HTML and PDF outputs for C++ Specification
| cxxhtml   | HTML outputs for C++ Specification
| cxxpdf    | PDF outputs for C++ Specification
|           |
| env       | HTML and PDF outputs for Environment Specification
| envhtml   | HTML outputs for Environment Specification
| envpdf    | PDF outputs for Environment Specification
|           |
| ext       | HTML and PDF outputs for Extensions Specification
| exthtml   | HTML outputs for Extensions Specification
| extpdf    | PDF outputs for Extensions Specification
|           |
| manhtmlpages | HTML outputs for Reference Pages
|====

The specification targets are generated in `out/html/` for HTML targets,
and `out/pdf/` for PDF targets.
The reference page target is generated in `out/man/html/`.
If a different output directory is desired, set the Makefile variable
OUTDIR on the command line. For example,

----
make OUTDIR=/tmp apihtml
----

will create `/tmp/html/OpenCL_API.html`.

These targets generate a variety of output documents in the directory
specified by the Makefile variable `$(OUTDIR)` (by default, `out`).

Once you have the basic build working, an appropriate parallelization option
to make, such as

----
make -j 6
----

may significantly speed up building multiple specs. The asciidoctor HTML
build is very fast, even for the whole Specification, but PDF builds may
take several minutes.


[[refpage-install]]
== Reference Page Installation

Most of the reference pages are extracted from the OpenCL API and OpenCL
C Specifications, although some are static.
While anyone can generate reference page sets for themselves, Khronos
publishes them via the `master` branch of the
https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/2.2/docs/man/[OpenCL Registry].

When the OpenCL Specification Editor is updating the published reference
pages, it is easiest to have local repository clones of this repository
(OpenCL-Docs) as well as OpenCL-Registry. Update the pages in the local
registry clone via

----
make -j 6 OUTDIR=path-to-registry-repo/sdk/2.2/docs manhtmlpages
----

This creates the HTML output pages under `sdk/2.2/docs/man/html`, and copies
the KaTeX package to `sdk/2.2/docs/katex`.
To publish, commit those changes to the registry repository and push it to
github.


[[styles]]
== Our stylesheets

We use a modified version of the Asciidoctor 'colony' theme. This theme is
maintained internally to Khronos and the resulting CSS is under
`config/khronos.css`.


[[equations]]
== Imbedding Equations

Where possible, equations should be written using straight asciidoc markup
using the _eq_ role.
This covers many common equations and is faster than the alternatives.

For more complex equations, such as multi-case statements, matrices, and
complex fractions, equations should be written using the latexmath: inline
and block macros.
The contents of the latexmath: blocks should be LaTeX math notation.
LaTeX math markup delimiters are now inserted by the asciidoctor toolchain.

LaTeX math is passed through unmodified to all HTML output forms, which is
subsequently rendered with the KaTeX engine when the html is loaded.
A local copy of the KaTeX release is kept in `katex/` and copied to the HTML
output directory during spec generation.
Math is processed into SVGs via `asciidoctor-mathematical` for PDF output.

The following caveats apply:

  * The special characters `<` , `>` , and `&` can currently be used only in
    +++[latexmath]+++ block macros, not in +++latexmath:[]+++ inline macros.
    Instead use `\lt`, `\leq`, `\gt`, and `\geq` for `<`, `<=`, `>`, and
    `>=` respectively.
    `&` is an alignment construct for multiline equations, and should only
    appear in block macros anyway.
  * AMSmath environments (e.g. pass:[\begin{equation*}], pass:[{align*}],
    etc.) cannot be used in KaTeX at present, and have been replaced with
    constructs supported by KaTeX such as pass:[{aligned}].
  * Arbitrary LaTeX constructs cannot be used.
    KaTeX and asciidoctor-mathematical are only equation renderers, not full
    LaTeX engines.
    Imbedding LaTeX like \Large or pass:[\hbox{\tt\small VK\_FOO}] may not
    work in any of the backends, and should be avoided.

See the "`Vulkan Documentation and Extensions`" document in the
https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/styleguide.html[Khronos
Vulkan Registry] for more details of supported LaTeX math constructs in our
toolchain.


[[anchors]]
== Asciidoc Anchors And Xrefs

In asciidoctor, sections can have anchors (labels) applied with the
following syntax:

----
[[spirv-il]]
== SPIR-V Intermediate language
----

In general the anchor should immediately precede the chapter or section
title and should use the form '+++[[chapter-section-label]]+++'.

Cross-references to those anchors can then be generated with, for example,

----
See the <<spirv-il>> section for discussion of the SPIR-V intermediate
language.
----

You can also add anchors on arbitrary paragraphs, using a similar naming
scheme.


[[depends]]
== Software Dependencies

This section describes the software components used by the OpenCL spec
toolchain.

Before building the OpenCL specs, you must install the following tools:

  * GNU make (make version: 4.0.8-1; older versions probably OK)
  * Python 3 (python, version: 3.4.2)
  * Ruby (ruby, version: 2.3.3)
  ** The Ruby development package (ruby-dev) may also be required in some
     environments.
  * Git command-line client (git, version: 2.1.4).
    The build can progress without a git client, but branch/commit
    information will be omitted from the build.
    Any version supporting the following operations should work:
  ** `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD`
  ** `git log -1 --format="%H"`
  * Ghostscript (ghostscript, version: 9.10).
    This is for the PDF build, and it can still progress without it.
    Ghostscript is used to optimize the size of the PDF, so will be a lot
    smaller if it is included.

The following Ruby Gems and platform package dependencies must also be
installed.
This process is described in more detail for individual platforms and
environment managers below.
Please read the remainder of this document (other than platform-specific
parts you don't use) completely before trying to install.

  * Asciidoctor (asciidoctor, version: 1.5.8)
  * Coderay (coderay, version: 1.1.1)
  * ttfunk (ttfunk, version: 1.5.1)
  * Asciidoctor PDF (asciidoctor-pdf, version: 1.5.0)
  * Asciidoctor Mathematical (asciidoctor-mathematical, version 0.2.2)
  * https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-mathematical#dependencies[Dependencies
    for asciidoctor-mathematical] (There are a lot of these!)
  * KaTeX distribution (version 0.7.0 from https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX .
    This is cached under `katex/`, and need not be
    installed from github.

Only the `asciidoctor` and `coderay` gems are needed if you don't intend to
build PDF versions of the spec and supporting documents.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
While it's easier to install just the toolchain components for HTML builds,
people submitting MRs with substantial changes to the Specifications are
responsible for verifying that their branches build *both* `html` and `pdf`
targets.
====

Platform-specific toolchain instructions follow:

  * <<depends-windows, Microsoft Windows>>
  ** <<depends-ubuntu, Ubuntu / Windows 10>>. The Windows 10 Ubuntu
     subsystem is recommended over MinGW and Cygwin for Windows builds, if
     possible, due to speed, similarity to the Linux toolchain, and the
     required packages being more likely to be up-to-date.
  ** <<depends-mingw,MinGW>> (PDF builds not tested)
  ** <<depends-cygwin, Cygwin>>
  * <<depends-osx,Mac OS X>>
  * <<depends-linux,Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)>>


[[depends-windows]]
=== Windows (General)

Most of the dependencies on Linux packages are light enough that it's
possible to build the spec natively in Windows, but it means bypassing the
makefile and calling functions directly.
This might be solved in future.
For now, there are three options for Windows users: Ubuntu / Windows 10,
MinGW, or Cygwin.


[[depends-ubuntu]]
==== Ubuntu / Windows 10

When using the "`Ubuntu Subsystem`" for Windows 10, most dependencies can be
installed via apt-get:

----
sudo apt-get -qq -y install build-essential python3 git cmake bison flex \
    libffi-dev libgmp-dev libxml2-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libcairo2-dev \
    libpango1.0-dev ttf-lyx gtk-doc-tools ghostscript
----

The default ruby packages on Ubuntu are fairly out of date.
Ubuntu only provides `ruby` and `ruby2.0` - the latter is multiple revisions
behind the current stable branch, and would require wrangling to get the
makefile working with it.

Luckily, there are better options; either https://rvm.io[rvm] or
https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv[rbenv] is recommended to install a more
recent version.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
  * If you are new to Ruby, you should *completely remove* (through the
    package manager, e.g. `sudo apt-get remove *packagename*`) all existing
    Ruby and asciidoctor infrastructure on your machine before trying to use
    rvm or rbenv for the first time.
    `dpkg -l | egrep 'asciidoctor|ruby|rbenv|rvm'` will give you a list of
    candidate package names to remove.
  ** If you already have a favorite Ruby package manager, ignore this
     advice, and just install the required OS packages and gems.
  * In addition, `rvm` and `rbenv` are *mutually incompatible*.
    They both rely on inserting shims and `$PATH` modifications in your bash
    shell.
    If you already have one of these installed and are familiar with it,
    it's best to stay with that one.
    One of the editors, who is new to Ruby, found `rbenv` far more
    comprehensible than `rvm`.
    The other editor likes `rvm` better.
  ** Neither `rvm` nor `rbenv` work, out of the box, when invoked from
     non-Bash shells like tcsh.
     This can be hacked up by setting the right environment variables and
     PATH additions based on a bash environment.
  * Most of the tools on Bash for Windows are quite happy with Windows line
    endings (CR LF), but bash scripts expect Unix line endings (LF).
    The file `.gitattributes` at the top of the vulkan tree in the 1.0
    branch forces such scripts to be checked out with the proper line
    endings on non-Linux platforms.
    If you add new scripts whose names don't end in `.sh`, they should be
    included in .gitattributes as well.
====


[[depends-ubuntu-rbenv]]
===== Ubuntu/Windows 10 Using Rbenv

Rbenv is a lighter-weight Ruby environment manager with less functionality
than rvm.
Its primary task is to manage different Ruby versions, while rvm has
additional functionality such as managing "`gemsets`" that is irrelevant to
our needs.

A complete installation script for the toolchain on Ubuntu for Windows,
developed on an essentially out-of-the-box environment, follows.
If you try this, don't try to execute the entire thing at once.
Do each step separately in case of errors we didn't encounter.

MATHEMATICAL_SKIP_STRDUP=1 gem install asciidoctor-mathematical -v 0.2.2
----


[[depends-ubuntu-rvm]]
===== Ubuntu/Windows 10 Using RVM

Here are (sparser) instructions for using rvm to setup version 2.3.x:

----
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm install ruby-2.3
rvm use ruby-2.3
----

NOTE: Windows 10 Bash will need to be launched with the "-l" option
appended, so that it runs a login shell; otherwise RVM won't function
correctly on future launches.


[[depends-ubuntu-sys]]
===== Ubuntu 16.04 using system Ruby

The Ubuntu 16.04.1 default Ruby install (version 2.3.1) seems to be
up-to-date enough to run all the required gems, but also needs the
`ruby-dev` package installed through the package manager.

In addition, the library
`/var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/mathematical-1.6.7/ext/mathematical/lib/liblasem.so`
has to be copied or linked into a directory where the loader can find it.
This requirement appears to be due to a problem with the
asciidoctor-mathematical build process.


[[depends-mingw]]
==== MinGW

MinGW can be obtained here: http://www.mingw.org/

Once the installer has run its initial setup, following the
http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started[instructions on the website], you
should install the `mingw-developer-tools`, `mingw-base` and `msys-base`
packages.
The `msys-base` package allows you to use a bash terminal from windows with
whatever is normally in your path on Windows, as well as the unix tools
installed by MinGW.

In the native Windows environment, you should also install the following
native packages:

  * Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * Ruby 2.x (https://rubyinstaller.org/)
  * Git command-line client (https://git-scm.com/download)

Once this is setup, and the necessary <<depends-gems,Ruby Gems>> are
installed, launch the `msys` bash shell, and navigate to the spec Makefile.
From there, you'll need to set `PYTHON=` to the location of your python
executable for version 3.x before your make command - but otherwise
everything other than pdf builds should just work.

NOTE: Building the PDF spec via this path has not yet been tested but *may*
be possible - liblasem is the main issue and it looks like there is now a
mingw32 build of it available.


[[depends-cygwin]]
==== Cygwin

When installing Cygwin, you should install the following packages via
`setup`:

----
// "curl" is only used to download fonts, can be done in another way
autoconf
bison
cmake
curl
flex
gcc-core
gcc-g++
ghostscript
git
libbz2-devel
libcairo-devel
libcairo2
libffi-devel
libgdk_pixbuf2.0-devel
libgmp-devel
libiconv
libiconv-devel
liblasem0.4-devel
libpango1.0-devel
libpango1.0_0
libxml2
libxml2-devel
make
python3
ruby
ruby-devel
----

NOTE: Native versions of some of these packages are usable, but care should
be taken for incompatibilities with various parts of cygwin - e.g. paths.
Ruby in particular is unable to resolve Windows paths correctly via the
native version.
Python and Git for Windows can be used, though for Python you'll need to set
the path to it via the PYTHON environment variable, before calling make.

When it comes to installing the mathematical ruby gem, there are two things
that will require tweaking to get it working.
Firstly, instead of:

----
MATHEMATICAL_SKIP_STRDUP=1 gem install asciidoctor-mathematical
----

You should use

----
MATHEMATICAL_USE_SYSTEM_LASEM=1 gem install asciidoctor-mathematical
----

The latter causes it to use the lasem package already installed, rather than
trying to build a fresh one.

The mathematical gem also looks for "liblasem" rather than "liblasem0.4" as
installed by the lasem0.4-devel package, so it is necessary to add a symlink
to your /lib directory using:

----
ln -s /lib/liblasem-0.4.dll.a /lib/liblasem.dll.a
----

<<Ruby Gems>> are not installed to a location that is in your path normally.
Gems are installed to `~/bin/` - you should add this to your path before
calling make:

    export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

Finally, you'll need to manually install fonts for lasem via the following
commands:

----
mkdir /usr/share/fonts/truetype cd /usr/share/fonts/truetype
curl -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmex10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmmi10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmr10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmsy10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/esint10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/eufm10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/msam10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/msbm10.ttf
----


[[depends-osx]]
=== Mac OS X

Mac OS X should work in the same way as for ubuntu by using the Homebrew
package manager, with the exception that you can simply install the ruby
package via `brew` rather than using a ruby-specific version manager.

You'll likely also need to install additional fonts for the PDF build via
mathematical, which you can do with:

----
cd ~/Library/Fonts
curl -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmex10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmmi10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmr10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/cmsy10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/esint10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/eufm10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/msam10.ttf \
     -LO http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/msbm10.ttf
----

Then install the required <<depends-gems,Ruby Gems>>.


[[depends-linux]]
=== Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

The instructions for the <<depends-ubuntu,Ubuntu / Windows 10>> installation
are generally applicable to native Linux environments using Debian packages,
such as Debian and Ubuntu, although the exact list of packages to install
may differ.
Other distributions using different package managers, such as RPM (Fedora)
and Yum (SuSE) will have different requirements.

Using `rbenv` or `rvm` is neccessary, since the system Ruby packages are
often well out of date.

Once the environment manager, Ruby, and `ruby_build` have been installed,
install the required <<depends-gems,Ruby Gems>>.


[[depends-gems]]
=== Ruby Gems

The following ruby gems can be installed directly via the `gem install`
command, once the platform is set up:

----
gem install asciidoctor -v 1.5.8
gem install coderay -v 1.1.1
gem install ttfunk -v 1.5.1

# Required only for pdf builds
gem install asciidoctor-pdf -v 1.5.0
MATHEMATICAL_SKIP_STRDUP=1 gem install asciidoctor-mathematical -v 0.2.2
----
