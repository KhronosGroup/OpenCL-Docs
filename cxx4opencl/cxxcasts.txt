[[cxxcasts]]
=== {cpp} casts

{cpp} has three cast operators in addition to C-style casts. Additional
logic specific to address spaces are applied to all casts as detailed in
<<address_space_casts, _conversions with address spaces_>>.
`reinterpret_cast` has some additional functionality:

* Conversion between vectors and scalars are allowed.
* Conversion between OpenCL types are disallowed.

==== Vectors and scalars

`reinterpret_cast` reinterprets between integral types like integers and
pointers. In {cpp} for openCL this also includes vector types, and so using
`reinterpret_cast` between vectors and scalars is also possible, as long as the
size of the vectors are the same.

[source,cpp]
------------
int i;
short2 s2 = reinterpret_cast<short2>(i); // legal.
int2 i2 = reinterpret_cast<int2>(i); // illegal.

short8 s8;
int4 i4 = reinterpret_cast<int4>(s8); // legal.
long l4 = reinterpret_cast<long>(s8); // illegal.
------------

==== OpenCL types

Some of the OpenCL-specific types, defined as "Other Built-in Data Types" in
`OpenCL C 3.0 s6.3.3`, are convertible to integer literals, but since they
are not conceptually integral, they can not be used with `reinterpret_cast`.
Therefore conversions of an OpenCL-specific type to any distinct type are
illegal.

[source,cpp]
------------
queue_t q;
reserve_id_t id = reinterpret_cast<reserve_id_t>(q); // illegal.
int i = reinterpret_cast<int>(id); // illegal.
