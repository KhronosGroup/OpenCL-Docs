=== Difference to OpenCL C

{cpp} for OpenCL provides backwards compatibility with OpenCL C
for the majority of features. However, there are a number of
exceptions that are described in this section. Some of them come
from the nature of {cpp} but others are due to improvements in OpenCL
features. Most of such improvements do not invalidate code written in
OpenCL C, but simply provide extra functionality.

==== C++ related differences

{cpp} for OpenCL is a different language to OpenCL C and it is derived
from {cpp} inheriting {cpp}'s fundamental design principles. Hence
{cpp} for OpenCL deviates from OpenCL C in the same areas where
{cpp} deviates from C. This results in a more helpful language for
developers and facilitates improvements in compilation tools without
substantially increasing their complexity.

===== Implicit conversions

{cpp} is much stricter about conversions between types,
especially those that are performed implicitly by the compiler.
For example it is not possible to convert a `const` object
to non-`const` implicitly. For details please refer to {cpp}17 `[conv]`.

[source,c]
----------
void foo(){
  const int *ptrconst;
  int *ptr = ptrconst; // invalid initialization discards const qualifier.
}
----------

The same applies to narrowing conversions in
initialization lists ({cpp}17 `[dcl.init.list]`). 

[source,c]
----------
struct mytype {
 int i;
};
void foo(uint par){
  mytype var = {
    .i = par // narrowing from uint to int is disallowed.
  };
}
----------

Some compilers allow silencing this error using a flag
(e.g. in Clang `-Wno-error=c++11-narrowing` can be used).

Among other common conversions that will not be compiled in C++
mode there are pointer to integer or integer to pointer
type conversions.

[source,c]
----------
void foo(){
  int *ptr;
  int i = ptr; // incompatible pointer to integer conversion.
}
----------

[[null_literal]]
===== Null pointer constant

In C and OpenCL C the null pointer constant is defined using other
language features as it is not represented explicitly i.e.
commonly it is defined as

[source,c]
----------
#define NULL ((void*)0)
----------

In {cpp}17 there is an explicit builtin pointer literal `nullptr` that should
be used instead ({cpp}17 `[lex.nullptr]`).

`NULL` macro definition in {cpp} for OpenCL follows {cpp}17
`[support.types.nullptr]` where it is an implementation-defined macro and it
is not guaranteed to be the same as in OpenCL C. Reusing the definition of
`NULL` from OpenCL C does not guarantee that any code with NULL is legal in
{cpp} for OpenCL even if it is legal in OpenCL C.

[source,c]
----------
#define NULL ((void*)0)
void foo(){
 int *ptr = NULL; // invalid initialization of int* with void*.
}
----------

To improve code portability and compatibility, implementations are
encouraged to define `NULL` as an alias to pointer literal `nullptr`.

===== Use of restrict

{cpp}17 does not support `restrict` and therefore {cpp} for OpenCL
can not support it either. Some compilers might provide extensions
with some functionality of `restrict` in {cpp}, e.g. `+__restrict+`
in Clang.

This feature only affects optimizations and the source
code can be modified by removing it. As a workaround to avoid manual
modifications, macro substitutions can be used to either remove the
keyword during the preprocessing by defining `restrict` as an empty
macro or mapping it to another similar compiler features, e.g.
`+__restrict+` in Clang. This can be done in headers or using `-D`
compilation flag.

===== Limitations of goto statements

{cpp} is more restrictive with respect to entering the scope of
variables than C. It is not possible to jump forward over a variable
declaration statement apart from some exceptions detailed in {cpp}17
`[stmt.dcl]`.

[source,c]
----------
if (cond)
  goto label;
int n = foo();
label:  // invalid: jumping forward over declaration of n.
   // ...
----------

===== Ternary selection operator

The ternary selection operator (`?:`) inherits its behaviour from both
{cpp} and OpenCL C. It operates on three expressions
`(exp1 ? exp2 : exp3)`. If all three expressions are scalar values,
the {cpp}17 rules for ternary operator are followed. If the result is
a vector value, then this is equivalent to calling
`select(exp3, exp2, exp1)` as described in `OpenCL C 3.0 s6.15.6`.
The rules from OpenCL C impose limitation that `exp1` cannot be a
vector of float values. However, `exp1` can be evaluated to a scalar
float as it is contextually convertible to bool in {cpp}.

==== OpenCL specific difference

This section describes where {cpp} for OpenCL differs from OpenCL C
in OpenCL specific behavior.

===== Variadic macros

{cpp} for OpenCL eliminates the restriction on variadic macros from
`OpenCL C 3.0 s6.11.f`.
Variadic macros can be used normally as per {cpp}17 `[cpp.replace]`.

===== Predefined macros

The macro `+__OPENCL_C_VERSION__+` described in `OpenCL C 3.0 s6.12`,
is not defined.

The following new predefined macros are added in {cpp} for OpenCL:

 * `+__OPENCL_CPP_VERSION__+` set to integer value reflecting the C++
   for OpenCL version the translation unit is compiled for. The value
   `100` corresponds to the language version 1.0 and `202100` corresponds
   to the version 2021.
 * `+__CL_CPP_VERSION_1_0__+` set to `100` and can be used for
   convenience instead of a literal.
 * `+__CL_CPP_VERSION_2021__+` set to `202100` and can be used for
   convenience instead of a literal.

===== Atomic operations

{cpp} for OpenCL relaxes restriction from `OpenCL C 3.0 s6.15.12` to
atomic types allowing them to be used by builtin operators, and not
only by builtin functions. This relaxation does not apply to
{cpp} for OpenCL version 2021 if the sequential consistency memory model
(i.e. `+__opencl_c_atomic_order_seq_cst+` feature) is not supported.

Operators on atomic types behave as described in {cpp}17
sections `[atomics.types.int]` `[atomics.types.pointer]`
`[atomics.types.float]`.
[source,c]
----------
// Assumes support of sequential consistency memory model.
atomic_int acnt;
acnt++; // equivalent to atomic_fetch_add(&acnt, 1);
----------

===== Use of Blocks

Blocks that are defined in `OpenCL C 3.0 s6.14` are not supported
and their use might be replaced by lambdas ({cpp}17 `[expr.prim.lambda]`)
in future versions.

The above implies that builtin functions using blocks, such as `enqueue_kernel`,
are not supported in {cpp} for OpenCL.
