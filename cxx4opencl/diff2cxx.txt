=== Difference to {cpp}

{cpp} for OpenCL supports the majority of standard {cpp}17 features,
however, there are some differences that are documented in this section.

==== Restrictions to {cpp} features 

The following {cpp} language features are not supported:

  * Virtual functions ({cpp}17 `[class.virtual]`);
  * References to functions ({cpp}17 `[class.mfct]`);
  * Pointers to class member functions (in addition to the regular non-member
    functions that are already restricted in OpenCL C);
  * Exceptions ({cpp}17 `[except]`);
  * `dynamic_cast` operator ({cpp}17 `[expr.dynamic.cast]`);
  * Non-placement `new`/`delete` operators ({cpp}17
    `[expr.new]`/`[expr.delete]`);
  * `thread_local` storage class specifier ({cpp}17 `[basic.stc.thread]`);
  * Standard C++ libraries ({cpp}17 `[library]`).

:fn-feature-macro: footnote:[The macro belongs to the list of {cpp}20's \
feature test macros.]

Simultaneous initialization of static local objects performed by
different work-items is not guaranteed to be free from race-conditions.
Whether an implementation provides such a guarantee is indicated by the
presence of the `+__cpp_threadsafe_static_init+` feature test
macro{fn-feature-macro}.

The list above only contains extra restrictions that are not detailed in OpenCL
C specification. As OpenCL restricts a number of C features, the same restrictions
are inherited by C++ for OpenCL. The detailed list of C feature restrictions
is provided in `OpenCL C 3.0 s6.11`.
