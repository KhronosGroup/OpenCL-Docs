[[intro]]
== Introduction

This language is built on top of OpenCL C v2.0 and {cpp}17 enabling
most of regular {cpp} features in OpenCL kernel code. Most functionality
from OpenCL C and {cpp} is inherited. The following two sections of this
document describe <<diff2openclc, _the differences to OpenCL C_>> and <<diff2cxx, _the differences to {cpp}_>>.

The majority of content covers the behavior that is not documented in
the OpenCL C v2.0 section 6 and {cpp}17 specifications. This is mainly
related to interactions between OpenCL and {cpp} language features.

== The {cpp} for OpenCL Programming Language 

This programming language inherits features from `OpenCL C v2.0 s6` as well
as C++17 (`ISO/IEC 14882:2017`). Detailed aspects of OpenCL and C++ are not
described in this document as they can be found in their official
specifications.
 
This section documents various language features of {cpp} for OpenCL that are
not covered in either OpenCL or C++ specifications, in particular:
 * any behavior that deviates from {cpp}17;
 * any behavior that deviates from OpenCL C v2.0;
 * any behavior that is not governed by OpenCL C and {cpp}.
