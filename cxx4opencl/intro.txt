[[intro]]
== Introduction

This language is built on top of OpenCL C v2.0 and {cpp}17 enabling
most of regular {cpp} features in OpenCL kernel code. Most functionality
from OpenCL C and {cpp} is inherited. Restrictions are documented
in <<restrictions, _Restrictions_>> sections.

The main aim of this document is to describe behavior that is not
documented in the OpenCL C and {cpp}17 specifications. This is mainly related
to interactions between OpenCL and {cpp} language features.

== The {cpp} for OpenCL Programming Language 
 
This chapter documents various language features of {cpp} for OpenCL.
